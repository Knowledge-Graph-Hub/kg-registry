description: The Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) is an
  information system designed to support the biomedical research community's work
  on bacterial and viral infectious diseases. BV-BRC combines data, technology, and
  user communities from PATRIC (bacterial system) and IRD/ViPR (viral systems),
  hosting hundreds of thousands of bacterial genomes and over a million viral genomes.
  The resource provides data on protein structure and function, clinical studies,
  drug targets and resistance, and epidemiology, along with open source tools for
  data analysis and genomic annotation. Funded by NIAID/NIH under Grant No. U24AI183849.
