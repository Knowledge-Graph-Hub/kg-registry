description: The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a robust, publicly
  available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures
  affect human health. CTD provides manually curated information about chemical-gene/protein
  interactions, chemical-disease and gene-disease relationships. The database, first
  released in November 2004, is supported by the National Institute of Environmental
  Health Sciences (NIEHS) and serves as a critical resource for toxicogenomics research.
