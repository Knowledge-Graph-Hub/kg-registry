description: Cell Maps For AI (CM4AI) is an NIH Bridge2AI Grand Challenge project focused on mapping
  cellular structure and function for AI applications. The project generates comprehensive
  datasets that catalog molecular and phenotypic responses to enable the development
  of AI models for understanding cellular processes. CM4AI is funded under NIH award
  1OT2OD032742-01 as part of the broader Bridge2AI initiative.
