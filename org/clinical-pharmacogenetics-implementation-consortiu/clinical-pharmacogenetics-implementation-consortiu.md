description: The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) is an
  international consortium that creates, curates, and posts freely available,
  peer-reviewed, evidence-based, updatable pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics (PGx)
  clinical practice guidelines. CPIC is part of the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research
  Network and is managed at Stanford University and St. Jude Children's Research
  Hospital. CPIC guidelines help clinicians understand how genetic test results
  should be used to optimize drug therapy, enabling the implementation of pharmacogenomics
  into clinical practice.
