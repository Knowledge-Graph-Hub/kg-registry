description: The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is a
  component of the NIH Common Fund's Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular
  Signatures (LINCS) program. The DCIC aims to create a network-based understanding
  of biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and other cellular processes
  that occur when cells are exposed to various genetic and environmental stressors.
  The center develops tools and resources to help researchers access and analyze
  LINCS data to understand cell pathways and develop therapies.
