description: BHKLAB is a Computational Oncology Lab at the Princess Margaret Cancer
  Centre that applies machine learning and artificial intelligence to cancer research.
  The lab develops computational tools for pharmacogenomics, drug response prediction,
  and cancer cell line authentication. Key resources developed by the lab include
  PharmacoDB, ToxicoDB, XevaDB, and PredictIO. The group emphasizes FAIR data
  principles, open science, and IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility)
  in their research practices.
