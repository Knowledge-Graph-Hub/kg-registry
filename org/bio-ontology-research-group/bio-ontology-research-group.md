description: The Bio-Ontology Research Group (BORG) at King Abdullah University of
  Science and Technology (KAUST) is led by Professor Robert Hoehndorf. The group
  focuses on the use of bio-ontologies for data integration and analysis in biology,
  working on biological problems that require integration of multiple types of data
  across scales and levels of granularity. Research areas include development of
  biomedical ontologies, their application to data integration and annotation, and
  ontology-based neuro-symbolic machine learning models for understanding rare and
  common human diseases, personalizing diagnosis and treatment, and prediction of
  functions and phenotypes.
