description: The Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) at Dana-Farber Cancer
  Institute was founded in 2004 to bring together scientists with cross-disciplinary
  interests in understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype. The
  center's long-term goal is to understand how macromolecular networks control
  biological processes and how perturbations in these networks explain phenotypes
  and human disease. CCSB researchers study protein-protein interaction networks,
  their global organization, topological features, and how cellular network
  organization is disrupted in disease.
