The Wikimedia Foundation is a nonprofit charitable organization headquartered in San Francisco, California. It operates some of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world, including:

- **Wikipedia**: A free online encyclopedia with millions of articles in hundreds of languages
- **Wikidata**: A free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines
- **Wikimedia Commons**: A collection of freely usable media files
- **Wiktionary**: A collaborative project to produce free-content multilingual dictionaries
- **Wikisource**: A library of free source texts
- **Wikispecies**: A directory of species

The Foundation was established in 2003 by Jimmy Wales as a way to fund Wikipedia and its sister projects through donations and grants. All Wikimedia content is made available under free licenses, allowing anyone to share and adapt the works for any purpose.
