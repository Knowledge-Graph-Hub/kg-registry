description: The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project started in 2008 as a
  collaboration between the Broad Institute and the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical
  Research. The goal is to conduct detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization
  of a large panel of human cancer models, develop integrated computational analyses
  linking pharmacologic vulnerabilities to genomic patterns, and translate cell line
  integrative genomics into cancer patient stratification. As of 2018, CCLE continues
  as part of the Broad Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) Project.
