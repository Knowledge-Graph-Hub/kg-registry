The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is part of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), a branch of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NCBI was established in 1988 as a national resource for molecular biology information.

NCBI is responsible for building, maintaining, and distributing GenBank, the NIH genetic sequence database that contains all publicly available DNA sequences. NCBI also maintains and distributes numerous other databases, including:

- **PubMed**: A free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics
- **RefSeq**: A comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of reference sequences
- **dbSNP**: A database of single nucleotide polymorphisms and other genetic variations
- **ClinVar**: A freely accessible archive of reports of relationships between human variations and phenotypes
- **Gene**: Information about genes across many species
- **PubChem**: A database of chemical molecules and their activities against biological assays

NCBI develops software tools for analyzing genome data, including BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), one of the most widely used bioinformatics programs.
