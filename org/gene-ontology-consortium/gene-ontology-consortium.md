description: The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration that develops and maintains the Gene Ontology knowledgebase, the world's largest source of information on the functions of genes. The GO provides a comprehensive, computational model of biological systems including molecular functions, cellular locations, and biological processes. The consortium also provides GO annotations and GO-CAM (Causal Activity Models) for understanding gene function across species.
