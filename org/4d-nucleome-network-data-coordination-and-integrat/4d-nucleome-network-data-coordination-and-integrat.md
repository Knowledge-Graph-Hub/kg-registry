description: The 4D Nucleome Network Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) manages the data portal for the 4D Nucleome (4DN) program. The 4DN Network aims to understand the principles behind the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus in space and time (the 4th dimension) and the role nuclear organization plays in gene expression and cellular function. The DCIC is based at Harvard Medical School.
