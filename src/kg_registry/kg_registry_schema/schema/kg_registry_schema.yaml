  ## Resource Classes

  Resource:
    description: >-
      A top-level class for all resources in the
      knowledge graph registry. Each resource may have multiple
      products or representations, but they will all be considered
      part of a the same parent resource.

      - schema:CreativeWork
    attributes:
      id:
        description: >-

  KnowledgeGraph:
    description: >-
      A knowledge graph resource. This is any heterogeneous collection of data
      that is represented as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) between
      them. The nodes and edges may have attributes associated with them.
      This is not identical to the graph *product*, as a single KnowledgeGraph
      may have multiple products or representations.

  DataGraph:
