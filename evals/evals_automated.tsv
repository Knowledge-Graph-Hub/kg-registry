biomarkerkg	Yes - BKG provides a web interface (BKG Explorer) for querying and exploring biomarker-anatomy, biomarker-compound, biomarker-condition, biomarker-role, and biomarker-variant relationships	Y	No - The BKG web interface does not provide direct API access based on available documentation	N	Yes - Multiple downloadable data formats available including CSV files organized by node and edge types from S3 bucket	Y	No - No public source code repository mentioned for KG construction	N	Yes - Individual CSV files for nodes (Anatomy, Biomarker, Compound, Condition, Role, Variant) and edges are available for download	Y	Yes - Integrates data from well-known sources: GlyGen Biomarker Database, Uber-Anatomy Ontology (Uberon), PubChem, Human Disease Ontology (DOID), and dbSNP	Y	No - Specific version information for source databases is not provided in the available documentation	N	Yes - Declares explicit relationships (node edge types): determined_using_sample_from (Anatomy), indicated_by_above/below_normal_level_of (Compound), diagnostic_for/indicates_risk_of/prognostic_for (Condition), has_best_classification (Role)	Y	Yes - Each product file is described with a specific relationship type (e.g., Biomarker to Anatomy relationships, Biomarker to Condition relationships)	Y	No - No explicit documentation of deduplication mechanisms at the edges level	N	Yes - Relationship types are clearly defined with meaningful semantic labels (diagnostic_for, prognostic_for, indicates_risk_of_developing, etc.)	Y	Yes - Uses Uberon anatomy, DOID disease ontology, dbSNP variant IDs, and PubChem compound identifiers which are resolvable	Y	No - Detailed construction documentation is not publicly available	N	No - Data transformation steps and filtering procedures are not documented in available resources	N	Yes - Clear edge type schema with defined semantic relationships between biomarkers and other entity types	Y	No - No formal versioning scheme mentioned (no v1.0, v2.0, etc.)	N	No - No public issue tracker or GitHub repository visible for tracking feature requests or bugs	N	Yes - Contact information provided: avi.maayan@mssm.edu (MaayanLab)	Y	Partially - KG is actively maintained but no formal update frequency documented (appears to be an active development project)	Y	No - No archived prior versions or changelog available	N	Yes - BKG is designed for biomarker discovery and exploration, relevant for clinical diagnostics and precision medicine applications	Y	No - No comparisons with other biomarker knowledge bases mentioned in available documentation	N	Yes - Focused scope on biomarker relationships across anatomical structures, compounds, conditions, roles, and genetic variants	Y	No - No quantitative evaluation metrics or benchmarks provided in available documentation	N	No - Accuracy, precision, recall, or other quality metrics are not reported	N	No - No explicit evaluation methods comparison provided in documentation	N			CC-BY-4.0 (inferred from MaayanLab standard practice; not explicitly stated in resource metadata)
