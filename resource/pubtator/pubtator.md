# PubTator 3.0

PubTator 3.0 is a comprehensive biomedical literature resource that leverages state-of-the-art AI techniques to annotate and make searchable over one billion entity and relation annotations across approximately 36 million PubMed abstracts and 6 million full-text articles from the PMC open access subset.

## Features

- Semantic search for six key biomedical entity types: genes, diseases, chemicals, genetic variants, species, and cell lines
- Relation search across 12 common relation types between entities
- Query auto-completion to enhance search accuracy
- Prioritized search results based on entity relationships
- Full-text search in both abstracts and open access articles
- Advanced filtering options
- Weekly updates to include new literature

## Technical Components

PubTator 3.0 is built on several advanced NLP components, all of which are available as open-source tools:

- **AIONER**: An all-in-one named entity recognizer for biomedical text
- **GNorm2**: A system for gene name normalization
- **tmVar3**: A tool for genetic variant normalization
- **BioREx**: A comprehensive biomedical relation extraction system

These components work together to provide highly accurate entity recognition and relation extraction, making PubTator 3.0 a valuable resource for biomedical researchers and data scientists.
