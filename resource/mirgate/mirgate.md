description: miRGate is a curated database of computationally predicted and experimentally
  validated miRNA-mRNA target pairs for human, mouse, and rat. The database integrates
  multiple prediction algorithms and includes sequences for both miRNAs and mRNA 3'-UTRs,
  along with experimentally validated data from four well-known databases. miRGate
  provides computational predictions using well-established algorithms and offers
  both a web interface and a REST API for programmatic access.

# miRGate

## Overview

miRGate is a curated database containing computational predicted and experimentally validated miRNA-mRNA target pairs. The database focuses on three model organisms: human (including human viruses), mouse, and rat. It provides predictions calculated using well-established algorithms and integrates experimentally validated data from multiple sources.

## Key Features

- **Computational Predictions**: Novel miRNA-mRNA pairs predicted using well-established algorithms
- **Experimental Validation**: Integrated experimentally validated data from four well-known databases
- **Comprehensive Sequences**: Updated and complete dataset of sequences for both miRNAs and mRNA 3'-UTRs
- **Multi-organism Support**: Coverage of human (including human viruses), mouse, and rat
- **API Access**: REST web service for programmatic access to the database

## Methodology

The underlying methodology of miRGate has been successfully applied to independent datasets, providing predictions that were validated by functional assays. The database addresses the challenge of limited overlapping results among different prediction methods by integrating multiple approaches based on sequence matching, thermodynamics, and conservation.

## Data Content

miRGate includes:
- Predicted miRNA-mRNA target pairs from computational algorithms
- Experimentally validated miRNA-mRNA interactions from curated databases
- Complete miRNA sequences for human, mouse, and rat
- mRNA 3'-Untranslated Region (3'-UTR) sequences
- Human virus-associated miRNA data

## Access

The database was accessible through:
- **Web Interface**: http://mirgate.bioinfo.cnio.es
- **API**: http://mirgate.bioinfo.cnio.es/API/

**Note**: As of November 2025, the miRGate website is no longer accessible.
