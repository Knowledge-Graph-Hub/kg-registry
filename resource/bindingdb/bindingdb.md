# BindingDB

BindingDB is a public, web-accessible database of measured binding affinities between small, drug-like molecules and protein targets. As the first public molecular recognition database, BindingDB supports research, education, and practice in drug discovery, pharmacology, and related fields.

## Database Content

BindingDB contains approximately:
- 3.0 million binding data measurements
- 1.3 million unique compounds
- 9.6 thousand protein targets

Of these, approximately 1.5 million measurements for 695,000 compounds and 4,700 targets were directly curated by BindingDB curators from scientific literature and patents.

## Data Sources

BindingDB integrates data from multiple sources:
- Articles curated directly by BindingDB staff
- US Patents (7,942 patents curated as of 2025)
- ChEMBL database
- PubChem
- PDSP Ki Database
- CSAR dataset
- Data from specialized labs

## Data Curation

BindingDB curates data from:
1. **US Patents**: Patents back to 2013 are included, containing 1.2+ million binding measurements across 599,874 compounds and 2,931 target proteins.
2. **Scientific Literature**: Selected journals are systematically curated, including:
   - ACS Chemical Biology
   - Biochemistry
   - ChemBioChem
   - Journal of Biological Chemistry
   - Nature Chemical Biology
   - And many others

## Data Access

The data is available through:
- Web interface for browsing and searching
- Downloadable datasets in multiple formats (SDF, TSV)
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- KNIME workflows for data retrieval and target prediction
- Browser extension (BDBFind) that integrates with scientific literature

## Special Features

- COVID-19 related binding data collection
- Target protein sequences in FASTA format
- Compound ID mappings to external databases (PubChem, ChEBI, DrugBank)
- Validation sets for computational methods
- Docked complex structures
