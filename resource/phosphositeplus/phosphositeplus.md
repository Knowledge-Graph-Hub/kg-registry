description: PhosphoSitePlus is a comprehensive resource for experimentally validated post-translational modifications (PTMs) with emphasis on phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation and more. It aggregates curated site-specific modification data, kinase–substrate relationships, protein domains, mutation impact annotations, sequence motifs, and pathway/interaction context to support signaling, proteomics, and systems biology research.

# PhosphoSitePlus

## Overview

PhosphoSitePlus aggregates high-quality experimentally validated post-translational modification (PTM) information, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation and others. Each modification site is annotated with residue position, surrounding sequence context, upstream enzymes (where known), literature references, and functional notes.

## Access

- Portal: interactive protein and site search, motif analysis, kinase–substrate browsing
- Downloads: bulk flat files for PTM sites, kinase–substrate pairs, regulatory and disease-associated annotations
- About/Methods: curation policies, evidence sources, data model explanation

## Citation

Please cite the latest PhosphoSitePlus update and foundational 2011 description paper when using the resource.
