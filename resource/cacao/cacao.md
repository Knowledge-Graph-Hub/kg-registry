# Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies

## Overview

CACAO (Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies) was an educational and collaborative annotation project that engaged undergraduate students in the process of biological curation using the Gene Ontology (GO). Students learned to annotate proteins by extracting evidence from scientific literature and applying standardized ontology terms.

## Project Goals

- **Education**: Train undergraduate students in biocuration and scientific literature analysis
- **Community Engagement**: Involve the broader scientific community in annotation efforts
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the quality of community-contributed annotations
- **GO Annotation**: Contribute to the Gene Ontology annotation corpus

## Methodology

- Students read and analyzed scientific papers
- Extracted evidence for protein function
- Applied appropriate Gene Ontology terms
- Documented evidence codes and supporting references
- Annotations were reviewed for quality and consistency

## Educational Value

- Hands-on experience with scientific literature
- Understanding of controlled vocabularies and ontologies
- Critical thinking about biological evidence
- Contribution to real scientific resources
- Introduction to bioinformatics and data curation

## Activity Status

The CACAO project appears to be inactive. The project website at gowiki.tamu.edu is no longer accessible, and recent updates or publications are not available. The project represents an important historical effort in community-based biocuration and educational outreach.
