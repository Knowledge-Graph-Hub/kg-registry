description: metaTraits is a unified and accessible microbial trait resource that
  integrates culture-derived trait information from BacDive, BV-BRC, JGI IMG, and
  GOLD, with genome-based predictions for medium- and high-quality isolate and metagenome-assembled
  genomes (MAGs) from proGenomes and SPIRE. metaTraits covers over 2.2 million genomes
  and more than 140 harmonized traits mapped to standardized ontologies, spanning
  cell morphology (e.g., shape, size, Gram staining), physiology (e.g., motility,
  sporulation), metabolic and enzymatic activities, environmental preferences (e.g.,
  temperature, salinity, oxygen tolerance), and lifestyle categories. All records
  are linked to their original evidence and cross-referenced to both NCBI and GTDB
  taxonomies.
