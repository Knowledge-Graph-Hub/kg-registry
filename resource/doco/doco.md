# Document Components Ontology (DOCO)

DOCO is an OWL ontology for describing the structural and rhetorical components of documents, enabling machine-readable representation of document structure including pages, sections, paragraphs, and other textual elements.

## Overview

The Document Components Ontology (DOCO) is part of the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies suite and provides a vocabulary for semantic annotation of document structure and rhetorical components. It was described in the paper "The Document Components Ontology (DOCO): Ontology and Use Cases" (Peroni et al., 2015) and has become important in academic publishing, digital humanities, and knowledge graph applications where structured document metadata is essential.

## Key Features

- Describes document structure (parts, sections, paragraphs, pages)
- Defines rhetorical and discourse elements (abstract, introduction, conclusions)
- Enables semantic annotation of document components
- OWL-based ontology for integration with other semantic web technologies
- Part of the larger SPAR ontologies ecosystem for scholarly communication

## Use Cases

- Academic publishing and scholarly communication
- Document structure preservation in knowledge graphs
- Semantic annotation of academic literature
- Text mining and natural language processing workflows
- Digital humanities and document digitization projects
