# PharmDB

## Overview

PharmDB (PharmDB-K) is an integrated pharmacological knowledge graph unifying drugs, targets, diseases, and related biomedical associations to support network pharmacology and drug repurposing analyses. While historically useful, the project has not shown recent update activity, so content should be treated as archival.

## Access

- Portal (legacy): browse integrated relationships and entity-centric views
- Graph: represented internally as PharmDB-K; no current standalone bulk export identified

## Status

The resource appears inactive. Links may function, but data curation and releases have likely ceased. Use with caution and verify critical relationships against more current sources.
