description: EVLncRNAs is a comprehensive database of experimentally validated functional long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) curated manually from low-throughput experimental studies. The database covers functional lncRNAs from 162 species, including disease associations, biological functions, interaction partners, structures, circular RNAs, exosomal lncRNAs, peptide-coding lncRNAs, and resistant lncRNAs. EVLncRNAs provides functional classifications based on Gene Ontology categories (biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and clinical applications), detailed interaction pathways, and integration with homologous lncRNAs, subcellular localization, phase separation, COVID-19, and organoid-related data.

    title: 'EVLncRNAs 3.0: an updated comprehensive database for manually curated functional long non-coding RNAs validated by low-throughput experiments'
    year: '2024'
---

# EVLncRNAs

EVLncRNAs is the first and exclusive comprehensive database of all experimentally validated functional long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from various species. Version 3.0 contains 6,195 functional lncRNAs from 162 species, representing a 154% increase from the previous version through exhaustive manual curation of nearly 25,000 publications from May 2020 to May 2023.

The database focuses on functional lncRNAs validated by low-throughput experimental methods (qRT-PCR, knockdown, northern blot, luciferase reporter assays) and excludes predictions from high-throughput sequencing alone. Coverage includes 1,726 diseases, 20,917 disease associations, 14,692 interactions, 87 peptide-coding lncRNAs, 11 structures, 440 circRNAs, 2,540 resistant lncRNAs, and 1,559 exosomal RNAs.

New features in version 3.0 include functional classifications following Gene Ontology categories, detailed interaction pathways, 765 homologous lncRNAs, 327 subcellular location entries, 32 COVID-19-related lncRNAs, 14 phase separation-associated lncRNAs, and 41 organoid-related lncRNAs. The database also features ChatGPT-generated summaries for the top 100 most frequently studied lncRNAs (with appropriate caution notes).

The most frequently studied lncRNAs include MALAT1, NEAT1, H19, and HOTAIR, which continue to show novel functions across various diseases and biological processes. The database demonstrates that functional lncRNA research remains a highly active field with over 3,000 related publications annually.
