description: MINT (The Molecular INTeraction database) is a public and open source
  database focusing on experimentally verified protein-protein interactions mined
  from the scientific literature by expert curators. Molecular interactions are annotated
  according to international PSI-MI standards and follow the PSI-MI controlled vocabulary.
  MINT is a founder and main member of the IMEx consortium and provides data that
  is integrated into the IntAct database as part of a single non-redundant open access
  dataset. As an ELIXIR Core Data Resource and Global Core Biodata Resource, MINT
  contains over 139,000 interactions involving 27,800+ interactors from 676 organisms
  extracted from 6,500+ publications.

## Description

MINT (The Molecular INTeraction database) is a comprehensive public repository for experimentally verified protein-protein interactions curated from peer-reviewed scientific literature. Developed and maintained by the University of Rome Tor Vergata, MINT serves as a critical resource for researchers studying molecular interactions and protein networks.

## Key Features

### Expert Curation
- Manual curation by expert biologists
- Extraction of experimental details from published literature
- Focus on experimentally verified interactions
- Comprehensive annotation of interaction context and methods

### Standards Compliance
- Annotated according to PSI-MI (Proteomics Standards Initiative - Molecular Interactions) standards
- Uses PSI-MI controlled vocabulary for consistency
- Provides data in standard PSI-MI XML and MITAB formats
- Compatible with PSICQUIC query protocol

### Database Statistics (Current)
- **Publications**: 6,515 curated papers
- **Interactions**: 139,980 protein-protein interactions
- **Interactors**: 27,802 unique proteins
- **Organisms**: 676 species represented

### IMEx Consortium Member
MINT is a founder and one of the main members of the International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) consortium. IMEx resources have merged their efforts to provide comprehensively annotated molecular interaction data integrated into a single, non-redundant, open access dataset stored and available through the IntAct database at EBI.

## Core Resources Status

- **ELIXIR Core Data Resource**: Recognized as part of the European life sciences infrastructure
- **Global Core Biodata Resource**: Designated as essential resource for global biomedical research

## Data Access Methods

### Web Interface
Interactive portal for:
- Searching protein interactions
- Browsing by species, publication, or interaction type
- Visualizing interaction networks
- Advanced field-specific queries

### Downloads
- Complete dataset via PSICQUIC web service

## Query Capabilities

### MIQL Syntax
Based on Lucene's syntax with support for:
- **Terms**: Single words or phrases (`brca2`, `"pull down"`)
- **Fields**: Search specific columns (`species:human`, `detmethod:"two hybrid*"`)
- **Operators**: OR, AND, NOT, +, - (`brca2 AND rpa1`)
- **Modifiers**: Wildcards, fuzzy search, proximity, ranges
- **Grouping**: Complex queries with parentheses

### Searchable Fields
- Identifiers (A/B or both)
- Aliases and alternative names
- Publication authors and PMIDs
- Taxonomic IDs and species names
- Interaction types and detection methods
- Interaction sources and identifiers

## Data Format Standards

### PSI-MI MITAB 2.7

- Interaction detection methods
- Publication references
- Organism information
- Confidence scores
- Cross-references to other databases

### PSI-MI XML

- Gene Ontology (functional annotations)
- Taxonomy databases (organism information)
- Other interaction databases via IMEx

## Community and Support

- Regular updates with new literature curation

## Historical Context

MINT was established as one of the first comprehensive protein interaction databases and has been continuously maintained and updated since 2002. As a founding member of IMEx, MINT has played a crucial role in establishing standards for molecular interaction data annotation and exchange.

## Future Development

MINT continues to:
- Expand literature coverage
- Improve curation workflows
- Enhance integration with IntAct
- Support emerging data types
- Maintain compliance with evolving standards
