## Overview

The Alliance of Genome Resources unifies knowledge from multiple model organism databases (MODs) and the Gene Ontology Consortium, harmonizing identifiers, nomenclature, and biological annotations to enable robust comparative genomics and translational research. Core data domains include gene function (GO), phenotypes, disease associations, alleles/variants, gene expression, orthology, and curated literature links. Cross-species integration supports inference of human disease mechanisms via model organism evidence.

## Access & Tools

- Web Portal provides integrated search and entity-centric pages.
- REST API offers structured JSON endpoints with an OpenAPI specification for discoverability.
- AllianceMine supplies customizable queries and result export.
- JBrowse 2 enables genome-level visualization.
- Textpresso facilitates literature text mining.
- Bulk Data Downloads furnish release-versioned snapshots for large-scale analysis.

## Data Integration

Data are sourced and synchronized from member MODs (FlyBase, MGD, RGD, SGD, WormBase, Xenbase, ZFIN) and the Gene Ontology Consortium, with standardized ontologies and identifier cross-references to ensure interoperability.

## Licensing & Citation

See the licensing and privacy page for data reuse terms. Please cite the Alliance and relevant member database publications when using integrated data. A formal citation suggestion is available on the "Cite Us" page.
