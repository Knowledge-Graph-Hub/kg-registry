dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) is a public archive for genetic variation established in 1999 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). It serves as a central repository for both single nucleotide variations and small-scale insertions and deletions (indels).

The database contains over 328 million reference SNPs (as noted on the homepage) and includes data on:
- Single nucleotide variations
- Small insertions and deletions
- Microsatellites and short tandem repeats
- Population allele frequencies
- Genomic and RefSeq mapping coordinates
- Molecular consequences and functional impacts
- Clinical significance annotations
- Links to associated publications

dbSNP assigns unique identifiers to variants (RefSNP or "rs" numbers) which are widely used in genomic research and clinical settings for consistent variant identification across different studies and platforms. The database is integrated with other NCBI resources including PubMed, Gene, ClinVar, and the NCBI Variation services.

The resource also includes the Allele Frequency Aggregator (ALFA) project, which provides allele frequency data from over 200,000 subjects with regular updates, aiming to eventually cover data from more than 1 million dbGaP subjects.

Data from dbSNP is available through a web interface, programmatic APIs like E-utilities and Variation Services, and bulk downloads via FTP in formats including VCF, JSON, and XML.
