# SNOMED CT

SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) is the most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology in the world. It serves as a standardized vocabulary for clinical documentation and enables consistent representation of clinical content in electronic health records.

## Overview

SNOMED CT provides a systematic, computer-processable collection of medical terms covering areas such as:
- Diseases
- Findings
- Procedures
- Microorganisms
- Substances
- Body structures
- Physical objects
- Physical forces
- Events
- Social contexts

The terminology contains more than 360,000 active concepts with unique meanings and formal logic-based definitions organized into hierarchies. SNOMED CT content is represented using three types of components:

1. **Concepts** - Each concept represents a unique clinical meaning identified by a unique, numeric SNOMED CT identifier.
2. **Descriptions** - Human-readable terms associated with concepts, including Fully Specified Names (FSN) and synonyms.
3. **Relationships** - Logical connections between concepts that define their meaning in a computer-processable way.

## Distribution and Licensing

SNOMED CT is owned, maintained, and distributed by SNOMED International, a not-for-profit association. As the United States National Release Center for SNOMED CT, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) provides SNOMED CT data and resources to licensees of the NLM UMLS Metathesaurus.

The SNOMED CT US Edition is released biannually (March and September) and combines content from both the US Extension and the International releases. The International Edition follows a monthly release cycle. Access to SNOMED CT requires an Affiliate License, which is free in SNOMED International Member territories (including the United States), in low-income countries, and for qualifying research projects.

## Applications and Benefits

SNOMED CT is designated as a standard for electronic exchange of clinical health information in many countries and is required in interoperability specifications of the U.S. Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. It is used in various clinical applications including:

- Electronic health records
- Clinical decision support
- Clinical and translational research
- Public health reporting
- Healthcare analytics
- Knowledge representation

Benefits include:
- Enabling consistent recording of clinical information
- Supporting real-time clinical decision support
- Facilitating interoperability and data exchange
- Enabling more accurate retrieval of patient data
- Supporting multilingual use through international translations
- Improving population health monitoring and research
