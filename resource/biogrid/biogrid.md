# BioGRID

BioGRID (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets) is an open, curated repository of genetic, protein, and chemical interaction data, PTMs, CRISPR screen results (ORCS), and themed biological curation projects across multiple species including human, budding yeast (S. cerevisiae), fission yeast (S. pombe), and Arabidopsis (A. thaliana). Monthly releases (e.g., 4.4.248) incorporate newly curated interactions and annotations. Data are available via a REST API and downloadable archives in multiple formats (MITAB, PSI-XML, TAB, project-specific subsets, PTM sites). All data are freely reusable under the MIT License with required citation of contributing authors and BioGRID publications.
