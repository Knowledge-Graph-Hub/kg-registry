# Autophagy Ontology

## Overview

The Autophagy Ontology (ATGO) is a hierarchical functional ontology developed through Active Interaction Mapping to systematically organize autophagy processes. Autophagy is a central cellular recycling process implicated in numerous diseases, making comprehensive functional organization critical for understanding its complex mechanisms.

ATGO was constructed using a progressive data-driven approach that integrates genetic interaction networks from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The ontology captures autophagy components in relation to broader cellular processes including vesicle transport, cell cycle regulation, and stress response.

## Key Features

### Hierarchical Organization

- **220 Functional Components**: Second-generation ontology representing comprehensive autophagy organization
- **Multi-level Structure**: Hierarchical relationships from specific autophagy genes to broad cellular processes
- **Data-Driven Construction**: Built from 156,364 synthetic-lethal genetic interactions

### Active Interaction Mapping Methodology

The ATGO ontology was developed through an innovative procedure called Active Interaction Mapping:

1. **First-generation model**: Built from existing gene networks capturing known autophagy components
2. **Synthetic-lethal analysis**: Systematic measurement of 156,364 synthetic-lethal interactions across autophagy-activating conditions
3. **Iterative refinement**: Data-guided expansion producing more comprehensive functional hierarchy

### Novel Autophagy Components

Approximately half of the 220 functions in ATGO were previously unknown, including confirmed roles for:

- **Gyp1**: Functions at the phagophore-assembly site
- **Atg24**: Involved in cargo engulfment
- **Atg26**: Participates in cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting
- **Ssd1, Did4**: Functions in selective and non-selective autophagy

## Applications

### Systems Biology Research

- Understanding hierarchical organization of cellular recycling
- Mapping functional relationships between autophagy and related processes
- Identifying novel autophagy components and mechanisms

### Disease Research

- Investigating autophagy dysfunction in disease contexts
- Identifying therapeutic targets within autophagy pathways
- Understanding connections between autophagy and stress response

## Technical Implementation

- **Organism**: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)
- **Data Foundation**: 156,364 synthetic-lethal genetic interactions
- **Coverage**: Vesicle transport, cell cycle, stress response, and autophagy-specific processes
- **Website**: Originally hosted at http://atgo.ucsd.edu/ (currently inactive)

##  Status

The ATGO resource website (http://atgo.ucsd.edu/) is no longer accessible as of 2025. The ontology and associated data were published in 2017 in Molecular Cell by the Ideker and Subramani laboratories at UCSD.
