# Orphanet

Orphanet is a unique resource gathering and improving knowledge on rare diseases to enhance diagnosis, care, and treatment of patients with rare diseases. It aims to provide high-quality information on rare diseases and ensure equal access to knowledge for all stakeholders.

## Overview

Established in France by INSERM (French National Institute for Health and Medical Research) in 1997, Orphanet has evolved into a European endeavor, gradually growing to a Consortium of 40 countries worldwide. The Orphanet database contains information on:

- 6,528+ rare diseases
- 4,512+ genes
- 8,722+ expert centers
- 36,595+ diagnostic tests
- 30,456+ professionals

## Key Resources

### Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO)

ORDO is a structured vocabulary for rare diseases derived from the Orphanet database. It captures relationships between diseases, genes, and other relevant features, providing integrated, re-usable data for computational analysis. The ontology is maintained by Orphanet and follows OBO guidelines.

### ORPHAcodes - Orphanet Nomenclature

The Orphanet nomenclature is a multilingual, standardized, controlled medical terminology specific to rare diseases. Each clinical entity is associated with a unique numerical identifier (ORPHAcode), preferred term, synonyms, and definition. The nomenclature pack includes files for implementing ORPHAcodes in health information systems.

### Orphanet Scientific Knowledge Base

This comprehensive collection of datasets provides structured information about rare diseases, including:
- Disease alignments with other terminologies (ICD-10, ICD-11, OMIM, UMLS, MONDO, MeSH, MedDRA, GARD)
- Classifications of rare diseases
- Gene associations
- Clinical signs and symptoms
- Functional consequences
- Epidemiological data
- Natural history information

## Recognition

Orphadata Science (which includes ORDO and the scientific knowledge files) has been recognized as:
- An ELIXIR Core Data Resource
- A Global Core Biodata Resource
- An IRDiRC Recognized Resource

## Data Access

All Orphanet data resources are available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, making them freely accessible for research and implementation. Data are updated bi-annually in July and December.
