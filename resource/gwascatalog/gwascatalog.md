description: The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog is a curated, searchable, and freely available
  database of SNP-trait associations from published and submitted genome-wide association
  studies. Expert curators extract reported traits, significant variant-trait associations,
  and study metadata, providing an integrated resource updated on a weekly cycle and
  accessible via web interfaces, bulk downloads, summary statistics, and a REST API.

## Overview

The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog provides a comprehensive, consistently curated, and publicly accessible collection of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results, including SNP-trait associations, study design and sample metadata, variant annotations, and trait ontology mappings. Data are curated by expert biocurators and released on a weekly schedule. Multiple access mechanisms are supported: interactive web portal, REST API, bulk downloads (TSV, JSON, OWL), ontology mappings, graphical diagram, and per-study summary statistics (including harmonised datasets).

## Access & Licensing

General usage is governed by EMBL-EBI Terms of Use. Unless otherwise noted, summary statistics are released under CC0. Users should also cite the 2025 Nucleic Acids Research publication (Cerezo et al. 2025) and individual studies when reusing summary statistics.
