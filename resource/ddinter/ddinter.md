# DDInter

## Overview

DDInter is an open-access database dedicated to drug-drug interactions (DDIs), providing comprehensive annotations and clinical guidance for managing potential adverse interactions between medications. Drug-drug interactions represent a significant patient safety concern, particularly in polypharmacy scenarios common in elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities.
