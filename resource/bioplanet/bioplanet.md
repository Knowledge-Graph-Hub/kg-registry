# BioPlanet

## Overview

The NCATS BioPlanet is a comprehensive, publicly accessible informatics resource that catalogues all pathways, their healthy and disease state annotations, and targets within and relationships among them. The BioPlanet integrates pathway annotations from publicly available, manually curated sources that have been subjected to thorough redundancy and consistency cross-evaluation via extensive manual curation.

The resource hosts information only from public sources that have been further manually curated to ensure the quality of the data. Along with the pathway warehouse, the NCATS BioPlanet software platform allows easy browsing and visualization of the universe of pathways, and exploration of associations among them.

## Information Resource ID

This resource has the Information Resource identifier: `infores:bioplanet`
