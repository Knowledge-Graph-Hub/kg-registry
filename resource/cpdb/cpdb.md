# ConsensusPathDB

## Overview

ConsensusPathDB was an integrated molecular interaction database that consolidated data from over 30 public databases, including protein-protein interactions, genetic interactions, metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, gene regulatory interactions, and drug-target interactions. It provided a comprehensive platform for pathway and functional analysis of molecular networks.

**Note**: This resource is currently **inactive**. The main website (http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/) is no longer accessible, and the database has not been updated since 2016.
