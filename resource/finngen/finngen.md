# FinnGen

FinnGen is a large-scale public-private partnership research project combining genome information with digital health record data from Finnish biobanks and health registries. The project aims to improve human health through genetic research and advance the development of personalized medicine.

## About FinnGen

FinnGen is one of the world's leading biobank studies, with the goal of collecting and analyzing genome and health data from 500,000 Finnish biobank participants. The unique genetic makeup of the Finnish population, characterized by genetic isolation and bottleneck effects, makes it particularly valuable for identifying rare genetic variants associated with diseases.

The project is coordinated by the University of Helsinki and includes:
- All Finnish public biobanks
- Finnish universities
- Hospital districts 
- International pharmaceutical companies
- Finnish research institutes

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Health Record Data

FinnGen combines genotype data with extensive digital health record data from national health registries, covering:
- Hospital visits and diagnoses
- Medication purchases and prescriptions
- Surgical procedures
- Cancer registry data
- Death registry data

This comprehensive longitudinal data, sometimes spanning decades for individual participants, enables powerful phenotype analyses across a wide range of diseases and conditions.

### Data Freezes

FinnGen regularly releases data in "freezes" as the project progresses, with each release including more samples and updated analyses:

- **Current Release**: Data Freeze 13 (DF13) - The most recent data release includes detailed clinical endpoint definitions and comprehensive GWAS results
- **Previous Releases**: Data Freezes 2-12 - Each with varying numbers of participants, genotyped variants, and phenotype endpoints

### Clinical Endpoints

The project has developed a significant collection of meaningful clinical endpoints based on digital health record data from Finnish health registries. These endpoints are carefully defined to enable precise genetic association studies across many disease categories.

## Applications and Impact

FinnGen data has been used in hundreds of scientific publications, contributing to the understanding of:

1. **Disease Mechanisms**: Identifying genetic factors contributing to common and rare diseases
2. **Drug Target Discovery**: Finding potential therapeutic targets for various conditions
3. **Genetic Risk Prediction**: Developing and validating polygenic risk scores
4. **Population Genetics**: Understanding the genetic structure and history of Finnish populations
5. **Pharmacogenomics**: Studying how genetic variation affects drug response

## Data Access

FinnGen follows the principles of open science and makes its data accessible to the research community while respecting privacy regulations:

1. **Summary Statistics**: Publicly available GWAS summary statistics for hundreds of phenotypes
2. **Risteys**: A public web interface for browsing phenotype information and summary statistics
3. **Controlled Access**: More detailed data available for qualified researchers through application

## Related Resources

FinnGen data is frequently used in combination with other biobanks and genetic resources, including:
- UK Biobank
- Estonian Biobank
- BioBank Japan
- Million Veteran Program
