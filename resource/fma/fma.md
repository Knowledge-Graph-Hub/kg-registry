description: The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) is a reference ontology for the
  domain of human anatomy. It is a symbolic representation of the canonical, phenotypic
  structure of an organism; a spatial-structural ontology of anatomical entities and
  relations which form the physical organization of an organism at all salient levels
  of granularity. The FMA contains approximately 75,000 classes and over 120,000 terms,
  with over 2.1 million relationship instances from over 168 relationship types.

# Foundational Model of Anatomy

The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) is a reference ontology for the domain of human anatomy, developed and maintained by the Structural Informatics Group at the University of Washington. It provides a comprehensive and coherent symbolic representation of the structural organization of the human body from the macroscopic to the molecular level.

## Overview

The FMA serves as a reference ontology in biomedical informatics for correlating different views of anatomy, aligning existing and emerging ontologies in bioinformatics, and providing a structure-based template for representing biological functions. It contains approximately 75,000 distinct anatomical concepts represented by specific terms and over 120,000 terms altogether. The FMA also includes more than 2.1 million relationship instances from over 168 relationship types.

## Features

- Comprehensive coverage of macroscopic and microscopic human anatomy
- Explicit representation of anatomical entities and relationships
- Spatial-structural ontology with multiple levels of granularity
- Formal definitions for anatomical structures
- Available in OWL and OBO formats for computational applications

## Resources

The FMA is available through BioPortal and the OBO Foundry. It is part of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and serves as a foundation for many other biomedical ontologies and applications.
