# ReproTox-KG

ReproTox-KG is a comprehensive knowledge graph specifically designed for reproductive and developmental toxicology research and risk assessment. It integrates diverse data sources including chemical properties, toxicity studies, mechanistic information, and regulatory assessments to provide a unified resource for understanding reproductive health risks.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Toxicology Integration
- Integration of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies from multiple databases
- Chemical structure and property data linked to toxicological outcomes
- Mechanistic pathway information connecting molecular targets to adverse outcomes
- Regulatory assessment data from international agencies (EPA, ECHA, FDA)

### Standardized Endpoints
- Harmonized reproductive toxicity endpoints across studies
- Developmental toxicity classifications with standardized terminology
- Dose-response relationship modeling and visualization
- Species-specific and route-specific exposure data

### Mechanistic Understanding
- Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) integration for mechanistic insights
- Molecular initiating events linked to reproductive outcomes
- Key events and biomarkers for reproductive toxicity
- Cross-species extrapolation frameworks

## Data Sources

### Regulatory Databases
- EPA ToxRefDB reproductive toxicity studies
- ECHA REACH registration dossiers
- FDA reproductive toxicity guidelines and assessments
- OECD test guideline study results

### Literature Sources
- PubMed abstracts focused on reproductive toxicology
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Case studies and epidemiological data

## Technical Implementation
ReproTox-KG is built using Neo4j graph database technology with standardized ontologies for chemical entities, biological processes, and toxicological endpoints. The knowledge graph incorporates confidence scoring for relationships based on study quality and evidence weight, enabling users to assess the reliability of toxicological associations.
