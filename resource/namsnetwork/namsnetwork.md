description: NAMs.network is the first database of regulatory-relevant New Approach
  Methodologies (NAMs) for assessing the safety of materials and chemicals. Given
  the ethical, economic, and time-related challenges associated with animal testing,
  as well as emerging bans on such methods in the EU, it is paramount to develop and
  validate alternative in silico, in chemico, in vitro, and ex vivo approaches. NAMs.network
  provides state-of-the-art knowledge on different NAMs for materials and chemical
  safety assessment.
