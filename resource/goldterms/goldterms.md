A rendering of the GOLD (Genomes OnLine Database) ecosystem classification as OWL, plus mappings to MIxS and environment ontologies. The ontology represents environmental classification paths from GOLD, organizing them into a hierarchical structure with three main branches:

1. Environmental - Representing natural environments (aquatic, terrestrial, etc.)
2. Host-associated - Representing environments associated with organisms
3. Engineered - Representing human-created environments

Each GOLD path is represented as a class with logical definitions equivalent to the path components. The ontology also includes mappings between GOLD paths and environment ontology expressions (primarily ENVO), conforming to MIxS standards, facilitating interoperability between environmental metadata systems.
