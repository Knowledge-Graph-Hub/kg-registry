# Genetics Home Reference

## Overview

Genetics Home Reference (GHR) was a consumer health resource provided by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) that offered information about genetic conditions and the genes or chromosomes related to those conditions. GHR provided health information in plain language to help patients, families, and healthcare providers understand how genetic variations affect health.

**Important:** As of 2020, Genetics Home Reference has been merged into **MedlinePlus Genetics** (https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/), which now serves as the primary NLM consumer genetics resource.

## Historical Content

### Genetic Conditions
GHR provided consumer-friendly information about more than 1,300 genetic conditions, including:
- Signs and symptoms
- Frequency in populations
- Genetic causes
- Inheritance patterns
- Treatment and management

### Genes and Chromosomes
The resource offered information about:
- More than 1,400 genes
- Gene function and location
- How gene changes relate to health conditions
- All 23 pairs of human chromosomes
- Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

### Educational Content

#### Help Me Understand Genetics
A comprehensive educational section covering:
- DNA structure and function
- What genes are and how they work
- Genetic mutations and variants
- Inheritance patterns
- Genetic testing and counseling
- Precision medicine and genomic research

## Key Features

- **Plain Language**: Written for patients and families without requiring scientific expertise
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covered common and rare genetic conditions
- **Evidence-Based**: Information reviewed by genetics professionals
- **Cross-Referenced**: Links to genes, chromosomes, and related conditions
- **Educational**: Explained complex genetic concepts accessibly

## Transition to MedlinePlus Genetics

In 2020, NLM integrated Genetics Home Reference into MedlinePlus Genetics to:
- Consolidate consumer genetics information
- Improve user experience through single portal
- Enhance searchability and navigation
- Integrate with broader MedlinePlus health resources
- Maintain and expand genetics content

### Current Access

All former GHR content is now available at:
- **Website**: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/
- **Genetic Conditions**: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/
- **Genes**: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/
- **Chromosomes**: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/chromosome/
- **Understanding Genetics**: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/

## Legacy Impact

GHR served for many years as a trusted resource for:
- Patients and families learning about genetic conditions
- Healthcare providers seeking patient education materials
- Students and educators in genetics education
- Researchers needing plain-language genetic information

## Information Resource ID

This resource has the Information Resource identifier: `infores:ghr`

## Recommended Alternative

Users seeking genetics consumer health information should visit **MedlinePlus Genetics** at https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/, which maintains and expands upon the content formerly available in Genetics Home Reference.
