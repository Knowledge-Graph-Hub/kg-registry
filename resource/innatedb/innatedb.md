# InnateDB

## Overview

InnateDB is a publicly available knowledge resource dedicated to the innate immune response. It provides comprehensive information about genes, proteins, experimentally-verified molecular interactions, and signaling pathways involved in innate immunity across humans, mice, and bovines. The database integrates data from major public databases with extensive manually-curated content to create a centralized resource for innate immunity research.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Manual Curation**: Over 18,780 interactions manually curated by the InnateDB team
- **Multi-Species Coverage**: Data for humans, mice, and bovines
- **Integrated Data**: Combines known interactions and pathways from major public databases
- **Systems Biology Tools**: Integrated bioinformatics and visualization tools for systems-level analysis
- **Comprehensive Content**: Genes, proteins, protein-protein interactions, and signaling pathways

## Content Coverage

### Molecular Entities
- Innate immunity-related genes
- Protein annotations
- Experimentally-verified protein-protein interactions
- Signaling pathways

### Analysis Capabilities
- Gene Ontology analysis
- Pathway analysis
- Network analysis
- Protein-protein interaction networks
- Integration with visualization tools

## Applications

- **Immunology Research**: Understanding innate immune responses to infection
- **Systems Biology**: Systems-level analysis of immune signaling networks
- **Drug Discovery**: Identifying potential therapeutic targets in innate immunity
- **Comparative Immunology**: Cross-species analysis of immune responses
- **Pathway Analysis**: Studying signaling cascades in immune responses
- **Network Biology**: Analyzing interaction networks in immunity

## Development Team

InnateDB is developed jointly by:
