### Petagraph: A Scalable Biomedical Knowledge Graph

**Petagraph** is a **biomedical knowledge graph** designed to integrate **multi-omics and clinical data** into a **richly annotated ontology-driven structure**. Built on the **Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG)**, Petagraph connects genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data, supporting advanced biomedical research and machine learning applications.
