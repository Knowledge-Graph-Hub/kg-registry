description: The Adverse Outcome Pathway Database (AOP-DB) is an EPA-developed integrative
  knowledgebase that connects chemicals and stressors to molecular initiating events,

# AOP-DB

## Overview

The Adverse Outcome Pathway Database (AOP-DB) supports chemical safety evaluation by integrating data that link molecular initiating events (MIEs) through key events (KEs) to adverse outcomes (AOs). By bridging multi-omic, pathway, and phenotypic evidence, the AOP-DB facilitates hypothesis generation, mode-of-action elucidation, and prioritization of chemicals for further testing.

## Scope & Content

- Molecular initiating events and downstream key events across biological levels
- Linkages between genes/proteins, pathways, phenotypes, and adverse outcomes
- Chemical associations and stressor mappings relevant to toxicological assessment
- Cross-references to public pathway, gene, and ontology resources (e.g., GO, Reactome)

## Use Cases

- Computational toxicology modeling and read-across
- Building structured Adverse Outcome Pathways for regulatory submissions
- Identifying data gaps in mechanistic evidence chains
- Prioritizing chemicals for targeted testing strategies

## Access

The current public EPA portal provides documentation and background on the AOP-DB. Additional programmatic or bulk access mechanisms may be added in future releases and can be incorporated here as products when available.

## Citation & Attribution

When using AOP-DB information, cite the EPA AOP-DB portal and any underlying pathway or ontology resources referenced in your analyses.

## Contact

General inquiries can be directed via the EPA website. Additional contact details will be added if dedicated AOP-DB communication channels are published.
