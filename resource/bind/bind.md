# Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND)

## Overview

The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) was a pioneering database designed to store full descriptions of interactions, molecular complexes, and pathways. It captured detailed information about experimental conditions, chemical dynamics, and cellular localization of interactions.

## Status

BIND is no longer active as a standalone public resource. In 2006, it was acquired by Unleashed Informatics and incorporated into the Biomolecular Object Network Databank (BOND). The original public website is no longer accessible. However, BIND data was widely disseminated and remains available through aggregator databases such as iRefIndex.

## Key Features

- **Interaction Data**: Detailed descriptions of molecular interactions.
- **Complexes and Pathways**: Storage of supramolecular complexes and pathway information.
- **Standardization**: One of the early adopters of standard formats for interaction data.
