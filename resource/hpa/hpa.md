  all human proteins in cells, tissues and organs using an integration of various
  omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics,
  transcriptomics and systems biology. The HPA aggregates and presents data from eight
  different resources covering tissue, brain, single cell, subcellular, cancer, blood,
  cell line, and structure & interaction atlases.

# Human Protein Atlas

The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) is a comprehensive Swedish-based program that aims to map all human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs using integration of various omics technologies. As one of the world's largest proteomics initiatives, HPA aggregates and presents data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive resource for understanding human protein expression and localization.

## About the Human Protein Atlas

The Human Protein Atlas integrates antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, transcriptomics, and systems biology to provide a comprehensive view of the human proteome. The resource is organized into eight interconnected atlases, each focusing on different aspects of protein biology.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Maps protein expression across tissues, cells, and disease states
- **Multi-modal Data**: Integrates antibody-based imaging, RNA-seq, mass spectrometry, and single-cell data
- **Open Access**: All data freely available under Creative Commons licensing
- **Regular Updates**: Quarterly releases with new data and improved annotations
- **Multiple Formats**: Data accessible via web portal, bulk downloads, and programmatic APIs

## Eight Atlas Resources

### 1. Tissue Atlas
Protein and RNA expression profiles in normal human tissues based on antibodies and transcriptomics, covering:
- 44 normal tissue types
- Over 15,000 protein-coding genes
- Immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq data

### 2. Brain Atlas
Detailed protein and spatial RNA expression profiles in the human brain:
- Regional brain expression mapping
- Cellular distribution in brain regions
- Neurological disease associations

### 3. Single Cell Atlas
Comprehensive single-cell RNA expression profiles across tissues:
- 700+ cell types across human tissues
- Single-cell transcriptomics data
- Cell type-specific expression patterns

### 4. Subcellular Atlas
Spatial subcellular protein localization in human cells:
- Immunofluorescence microscopy
- Organelle-specific protein distribution
- Subcellular compartment mapping

### 5. Cancer Atlas
Protein and RNA profiles in human cancers:
- 17 major cancer types
- Prognostic significance analysis
- Cancer-specific expression patterns

### 6. Blood Atlas
Blood protein levels in health and disease:
- Plasma protein concentrations
- Disease-specific protein signatures
- Longitudinal studies across age groups

### 7. Cell Line Atlas
RNA expression profiles in human cell lines:
- Cancer cell line models
- Tissue-specific cell line collections
- Comparative expression analysis

### 8. Structure & Interaction Atlas
3D protein structures, interaction networks, and metabolic pathways:
- Protein structure predictions
- Protein-protein interaction networks
- Metabolic pathway integration

## Data Types and Formats

### Expression Data
- **Tissue Expression**: Immunohistochemistry-based protein expression
- **RNA Expression**: Transcriptomic data from RNA-seq analyses
- **Single Cell**: scRNA-seq expression profiles
- **Blood Proteins**: Mass spectrometry-based plasma protein levels

### Localization Data
- **Subcellular**: Immunofluorescence-based protein localization
- **Tissue Distribution**: Organ and tissue-specific expression patterns
- **Disease Context**: Pathological expression changes

### Data Formats
- **Bulk Downloads**: Complete datasets in TSV, JSON, and XML formats
- **Individual Entries**: Per-protein data via RESTful APIs
- **Integrated Views**: Web-based visualization and exploration tools

## Applications

The Human Protein Atlas serves multiple research communities:

### Biomedical Research
- Disease biomarker discovery
- Drug target identification
- Therapeutic development support

### Basic Biology
