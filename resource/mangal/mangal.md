# mangal.io

## Overview

mangal.io is a collaborative platform dedicated to ecological network data. It provides a centralized database of published food webs, pollination networks, plant-herbivore networks, and other species interaction networks from the scientific literature.

## Features

- **Network Database**: Collection of ecological interaction networks from peer-reviewed studies
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive visualization and exploration of network structures
- **Analysis Platform**: Tools for analyzing network properties and metrics
- **Data Interoperability**: Standardized data formats for network data exchange
- **API Access**: Programmatic access to network data and metadata

## Data Types

The platform includes various types of ecological networks:
- Food webs and trophic networks
- Pollination networks
- Plant-herbivore interaction networks
- Parasite-host networks
- Mutualistic networks
- Other biotic interaction networks

## Citation

When using mangal.io data, please cite the original studies associated with each network along with the mangal.io platform.
