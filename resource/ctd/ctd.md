  description: The EPA has developed the Adverse Outcome Pathway Database (AOP-DB)
    to better characterize adverse outcomes of toxicological interest that are relevant
    to human health and the environment. Since its inception, the AOP-DB has been
    developed with the aim of integrating AOP molecular target information with other
    publicly available datasets to facilitate computational analyses of AOP information.
