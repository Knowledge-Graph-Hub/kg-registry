description: MedKG is a comprehensive and continuously updated knowledge graph designed
  to address challenges in precision medicine and drug discovery. MedKG integrates
  data from 35 authoritative sources, encompassing 34 node types and 79 relationships.
  A Continuous Integration/Continuous Update pipeline ensures MedKG remains current,
  addressing a critical limitation of static knowledge bases. The integration of molecular
  embeddings enhances semantic analysis capabilities, bridging the gap between chemical
  structures and biological entities.
