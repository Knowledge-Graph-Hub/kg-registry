Bgee (Background Expression) is a database for retrieval and comparison of gene expression patterns across multiple animal species. It integrates multiple data types (RNA-Seq, Affymetrix microarrays, in situ hybridization, EST data, and single-cell RNA-Seq) to provide a unified view of gene expression patterns across diverse anatomical structures, developmental stages, and species.

The key features of Bgee include:

- Integration of multiple expression data types from various sources
- Careful curation of expression data, including quality assessment and filtering
- Mapping of expression data to anatomical and developmental ontologies
- Cross-species comparisons of gene expression patterns using anatomical homology relationships
- Expression calls that indicate the presence/absence of gene expression in specific conditions
- Anatomical homology relationships between species to facilitate evolutionary comparisons
- Data processing pipelines that ensure standardized analysis across different data sources

Bgee is widely used in comparative genomics, evolutionary developmental biology, and functional genomics to understand gene expression patterns and their evolution across species. The database currently covers more than 29 animal species including key model organisms such as human, mouse, zebrafish, and Drosophila.

The data is available through a user-friendly web interface, a SPARQL endpoint for semantic web queries, programmatic access via R and Python packages, and bulk downloads of data dumps for large-scale analyses.
