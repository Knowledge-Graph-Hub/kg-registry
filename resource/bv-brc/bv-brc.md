  title: Introducing the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC): a resource combining PATRIC, IRD and ViPR
  year: "2022"
repository: https://github.com/BV-BRC

## Overview

The Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) is an information system designed to support the biomedical research community's work on bacterial and viral infectious diseases via integration of vital pathogen information with rich data and analysis tools. BV-BRC combines the data, technology, and extensive user communities from two long-running centers: PATRIC, the bacterial system, and IRD/ViPR, the viral systems.

## Features

- Support for diverse bacterial and viral infectious disease research communities
- Integration of PATRIC and IRD/ViPR resources into a unified resource
- Unified data model, database, and real-time data integration processes
- Consistent and accurate genome annotations and other derived data types
- Automated and manual curation of high value data and metadata
- Integrated analysis of multi-omics systems biology data using visual analytics tools
- Phylogenomic and epidemiological analysis for rapid outbreak response
- Explainable AI/machine learning based tools
- Private user workspace for data analysis, sharing and publishing
- Programmatic and batch access via APIs, Command-line Interface (CLI), and FTP

## Data Content

BV-BRC includes hundreds of thousands of bacterial genomes from PATRIC and over a million viral genomes from IRD/ViPR. It also hosts data on protein structure and function, clinical studies, drug targets and resistance, epidemiology, and other features.

## History

BV-BRC was formed by combining two historically independent efforts: PATRIC (Pathosystems Resource Integration Center) for bacterial data and IRD/ViPR (Influenza Research Database/Virus Pathogen Resource) for viral data. It represents an evolution and integration of these previously separate resources.

BV-BRC is the successor to PATRIC, incorporating all of PATRIC's bacterial data and functionality while expanding to include viral data from IRD/ViPR. Researchers who previously used PATRIC for bacterial genomics and bioinformatics should now use BV-BRC as it contains all the data and tools from PATRIC plus additional resources and capabilities.
