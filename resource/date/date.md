# Drugs to target pAthways by the Tissue Expression

## Overview

DATE (Drugs to target pAthways by the Tissue Expression) was a computational resource developed to integrate drug-target information with biological pathway data and tissue-specific gene expression patterns. The goal was to predict tissue-specific drug effects and identify therapeutic opportunities based on pathway perturbations in specific tissue contexts.

## Approach

- **Drug-Target Integration**: Connected drugs to their molecular targets
- **Pathway Mapping**: Linked targets to biological pathways
- **Tissue Expression**: Incorporated tissue-specific gene expression data
- **Systems Pharmacology**: Predicted tissue-specific drug effects

## Applications

- Predicting tissue-specific adverse drug effects
- Identifying repurposing opportunities
- Understanding drug mechanism of action in context
- Prioritizing therapeutic targets by tissue

## Activity Status

The DATE resource appears to be inactive. The homepage URL points to an archived ZIP file on Amazon S3, suggesting the resource is no longer actively maintained or updated. No recent publications or updates are available.
