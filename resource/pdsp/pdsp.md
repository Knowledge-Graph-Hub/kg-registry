# Psychoactive Drug Screening Program

## Overview

The Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) at UNC Chapel Hill provides screening of novel psychoactive compounds for pharmacological and functional activity at cloned human or rodent CNS receptors, channels, and transporters.

Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), PDSP offers both screening services and a comprehensive database of receptor binding data (Ki values) for thousands of psychoactive drugs and drug candidates.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Receptor Panel**: Screening across 50+ CNS receptors, channels, and transporters
- **Ki Database**: Binding affinity data for thousands of compounds
- **Standardized Assays**: Validated radioligand binding and functional assays
- **Drug Discovery Support**: Critical pharmacological data for lead optimization
- **Public Access**: Free database access for research community

## Research Applications

- Drug discovery and lead optimization
- Off-target effect prediction
- Polypharmacology analysis
- Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies
- CNS drug safety assessment

## Products

### PDSP Ki Database
Searchable web database containing receptor binding affinities (Ki values) for psychoactive drugs and drug candidates across multiple neuroreceptor targets.

### PDSP Binding Data
Downloadable datasets of receptor binding data for computational analysis and modeling.

### Assay Protocols
Detailed protocols for PDSP's standardized receptor binding and functional assays.
