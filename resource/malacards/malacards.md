# MalaCards

MalaCards is a comprehensive, searchable database of human diseases developed by LifeMap Sciences and the Weizmann Institute of Science. It integrates information from 78 trusted data sources to provide comprehensive annotations for over 22,000 human disorders. MalaCards includes data on disease-associated genes, symptoms, drugs, mutations, publications, clinical trials, pathways, and related diseases. The database is organized into global categories (cancer, genetic, rare, infectious, metabolic, and fetal diseases) and anatomical categories (neuronal, cardiovascular, blood, bone, and other organ system diseases).
