description: GeneCards is a comprehensive, integrative database that aggregates gene-centric
  information from over 200 web sources. It provides searchable access to genomic,
  transcriptomic, proteomic, genetic, clinical and functional information for all
  annotated and predicted human genes. GeneCards automatically integrates data on
  gene function, pathways, diseases, variants, expression patterns, protein interactions,
  and more. The database includes over 443,000 gene entries with rich annotations
  from sources including HGNC, OMIM, Ensembl, UniProt, NCBI Gene, GTEx, PubMed, and
  many other major biomedical databases. GeneCards serves as a central hub for human
  gene information, making it accessible to researchers worldwide.

# GeneCards

## Overview

GeneCards is a comprehensive, searchable database that provides integrative, gene-centric information on all annotated and predicted human genes. Developed by the Weizmann Institute of Science and maintained by LifeMap Sciences, GeneCards automatically integrates data from over 200 authoritative web sources to create unified gene cards for each human gene.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Integration**: Aggregates data from ~200 databases including HGNC, OMIM, Ensembl, UniProt, NCBI Gene, and many others
- **Gene Coverage**: Over 443,000 gene entries including protein-coding genes, ncRNAs, pseudogenes, and other functional elements
- **Multi-Dimensional Data**: Genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, genetic, clinical and functional information
- **Disease Associations**: Extensive disease-gene relationships from clinical and research databases
- **Expression Patterns**: Tissue and cell-type specific expression data from multiple sources
- **Pathway Integration**: Comprehensive pathway and biological process annotations
- **Variant Information**: Genetic variant data including clinical significance
- **Literature Mining**: Automatically associated PubMed references
