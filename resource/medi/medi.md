# MeDI (MATRIX Indication List)

## Overview

MEDI (MATRIX Indication List) is a curated dataset developed by the Every Cure organization that provides structured drug-indication and drug-contraindication relationships extracted from FDA DailyMed product labels. The resource uses large language models (LLMs) to systematically extract therapeutic indications and contraindications from drug labels, providing high-quality ground truth data for computational drug repurposing research.

## Data Content

MEDI includes:
- Drug indications extracted from DailyMed product labels
- Drug contraindications identified from safety information
- Mappings to standardized disease ontology terms (MONDO)
- Ground truth datasets for training predictive models

## Extraction Methodology

The dataset is generated through:
- Automated extraction from FDA DailyMed using LLMs
- Integration with EMA (European Medicines Agency) and PMDA (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency) indications data
- Systematic normalization and mapping to MONDO ontology terms
- Quality control and validation processes

## Use Cases

MEDI serves as:
- Training data for drug repurposing prediction models
- Reference dataset for validating computational drug repositioning approaches
- Source of structured drug-disease relationships for knowledge graphs
- Ground truth for evaluating machine learning models in pharmacology

## Technical Implementation

The project uses:
- Jupyter Notebooks for data processing pipelines
- Automated data ingestion from DailyMed, EMA, and PMDA sources
- MONDO ontology integration for disease term standardization
- Version-controlled releases on GitHub

## Developed By

Every Cure organization, with primary development by Marcello DeLuca and contributors.

## Access

The dataset and processing code are freely available through the GitHub repository with regular versioned releases.
