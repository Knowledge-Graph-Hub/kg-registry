description: The NLM Cell Knowledge Network, a knowledge graph that contains knowledge
  about cellular phenotypes (cell types and cell states) that has been gathered through
  single cell technologies and related experiments. NLM-CKN is populated using validated
  computational analysis pipelines and natural language processing of scientific literature
  and integrated with other public sources of relevant knowledge about genes, anatomical
  structures, diseases, and drugs.
