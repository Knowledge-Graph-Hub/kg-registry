## Overview

CDISC Controlled Terminology is developed and maintained through a collaboration between the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) and the National Cancer Institute's Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS). The terminology provides the standardized codelists and valid values required for CDISC-compliant datasets used in submissions to regulatory agencies such as the FDA and PMDA.

Controlled Terminology does not define what data to collect, but rather specifies how to represent and submit collected data in electronic datasets. The terminology undergoes extensive content development and public review with broad participation from the research and healthcare community.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports multiple CDISC foundational standards including SDTM, CDASH, ADaM, SEND, Define-XML, Protocol, and therapeutic area standards
- **Multiple Formats**: Available in Excel, text, ODM XML, PDF, HTML, and OWL/RDF formats
- **Regular Updates**: Quarterly releases with detailed change tracking and version control
- **Integrated with NCI Thesaurus**: Maintained as part of NCIt, ensuring semantic consistency and interoperability
- **Free Access**: Available without licensing restrictions from NCI EVS FTP site
- **Community-Driven**: New term requests and changes can be submitted through the CDISC Term Request system
- **Regulatory Acceptance**: Required for FDA and PMDA submissions in CDISC-compliant formats

## Terminology Components

### Foundational Standards

### Therapeutic Area Standards
Specialized extensions for disease-specific implementations including oncology, cardiovascular, neurology, infectious diseases, rare diseases, and other therapeutic areas.

## Update Frequency

CDISC Controlled Terminology is updated quarterly with comprehensive release packages. Each release includes:
