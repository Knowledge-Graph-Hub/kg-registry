  title: "SIB Literature Services: RESTful customizable search engines in biomedical literature, enriched with automatically mapped biomedical concepts"
  year: '2020'
---
SIBiLS (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Literature Services) provides personalized information retrieval services in biological literature. The platform offers fully customizable search capabilities in semantically enriched contents based on keywords and/or mapped biomedical entities from a growing set of standardized and legacy vocabularies.

The services cover four main collections that are updated daily:
- MEDLINE citations
- PubMed Central (PMC) full texts
- Plazi treatments (taxonomic treatments from biodiversity literature)
- PMC supplementary files

Key features of SIBiLS include:
- Semantically enriched content with billions of mapped biomedical entities
- Customizable search engines to assist curation of genes and gene products
- RESTful APIs for programmatic access to literature services
- Natural language question answering capabilities
- Specialized services for different domains (biodiversity, biotechnology, genetic variations)
- SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries

SIBiLS content is parsed and enriched with mapped biomedical entities from reference vocabularies, making it particularly valuable for life science researchers and curation teams. The platform is built on modern technologies that scale with big data, including MongoDB and Elasticsearch.

The services are developed by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in collaboration with the Haute Ecole de Gestion in Geneva and are supported by Elixir, swissuniversities, and HES-SO. The tagged entities in SIBiLS are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Switzerland License.
