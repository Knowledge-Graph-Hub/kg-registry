description: The Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) is a comprehensive cancer
  cell line profiling resource that links genetic, lineage, and other cellular features
  of cancer cell lines to small-molecule sensitivity with the goal of accelerating
  discovery of patient-matched cancer therapeutics. Developed by researchers at the
  Broad Institute Center for the Science of Therapeutics as part of the NCI Cancer
  Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Network, CTRP measured the sensitivity of
  860 deeply characterized human cancer cell lines encompassing 25 lineages to an
  Informer Set of 481 small-molecule probes and drugs that selectively target distinct
  nodes in cell circuitry. The resource provides correlations between small-molecule
  sensitivity patterns and basal gene expression profiles from the Cancer Cell Line
  Encyclopedia (CCLE) across approximately 19,000 transcripts, enabling identification
  of mechanisms of action, cellular targets, metabolic processing pathways, and drug
  resistance mechanisms. CTRP measurements were performed over 16-point concentration
  ranges in duplicate using automated high-throughput workflows, with cellular ATP
  levels assessed 72 hours after compound treatment as a surrogate for viability.
  The portal provides interactive tools for exploring clustering by small molecule
  and cell line, enrichment analyses for annotations, correlations to copy-number
  and gene-expression data, on-the-fly correlation analysis, box-whisker visualizations,
  drill-down to scatter plots and concentration-response curves, and filtering by
  lineage, subtype, or growth mode. CTRP enables correlation of chemical sensitivity
  with basal gene expression to reveal direct target connections, target pathway relationships,
  metabolic activation mechanisms, small-molecule import and export mechanisms, and
  novel therapeutic targets, supporting the identification of predictive biomarkers
  for patient-matched therapeutics and the systematic characterization of small-molecule
  mechanisms of action.
