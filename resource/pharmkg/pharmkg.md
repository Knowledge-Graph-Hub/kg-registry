  PharmKG is a multi-relational, attributed biomedical knowledge graph benchmark
  that integrates curated databases and literature-derived relationships to link
  genes, drugs (chemicals), and diseases. It contains ~500,000 typed relations
  across ~7,600â€“8,000 disambiguated entities (29 relation types), with
  domain-specific features for entities from multi-omics sources (e.g., gene
  expression, chemical structure, disease embeddings). It provides baselines for
  knowledge graph embedding and a neural network-based method, and supports
  downstream tasks such as drug repurposing and target identification.
