# DISEASES

## Overview

DISEASES is a comprehensive database that integrates disease-gene associations from multiple evidence sources. Maintained by the JensenLab and currently hosted at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (University of Zurich), it provides weekly updated data combining automatic text mining, manually curated knowledge, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies. The resource assigns unified confidence scores to facilitate comparison across different types of evidence.

## Data Content

DISEASES integrates disease-gene associations through four main channels:

### 1. Text Mining Channel
- Automatic extraction of disease-gene mentions from scientific literature
- Z-scores indicating co-mention strength
- Confidence scores for each association
- Links to underlying abstracts

### 2. Knowledge Channel
- Manually curated disease-gene associations from literature
- Evidence type classification
- Source database attribution
- Confidence scores

### 3. Experiments Channel
- Cancer mutation data
- Genome-wide association study (GWAS) results
- Source scores from original databases
- Confidence scores

### 4. Integrated Channel
- Experimental combination of all evidence sources
- Unified confidence scoring across channels
- Non-redundant filtered associations

## Data Organization

All downloadable files contain:
- Gene identifier and name
- Disease identifier and name
- Channel-specific evidence metrics
- Confidence scores for comparison

**Full datasets**: Complete associations from the database
**Filtered datasets**: Non-redundant associations shown in the web interface

## Key Features

- **Weekly Updates**: Regular integration of new evidence from literature and databases
- **Multiple Evidence Types**: Text mining, curated knowledge, experimental data
- **Confidence Scores**: Unified scoring system for comparing evidence quality
- **Human-Specific**: Focus on human disease-gene associations
- **Open Access**: All data available under CC BY 4.0 license
- **Interactive Search**: Web interface for exploring associations

## Access Methods

- **Web Interface**: Search and browse at https://diseases.jensenlab.org/
- **Direct Downloads**: TSV files for each channel (full and filtered)
- **Dictionary**: Gene and disease name dictionary for local text mining
- **Historical Data**: Previous versions archived on figshare

## Download Products

Each channel available in two versions:
1. **Full**: All associations in the database
2. **Filtered**: Non-redundant associations (shown in web interface)

Additional resources:
- DISEASES tagger for local installation (Unix platforms)
- Disease and gene name dictionary
- Benchmark dataset from original publication
- List of excluded PubMed IDs (papermill publications)

## Use Cases

1. **Disease Gene Discovery**: Identify candidate genes for diseases of interest
2. **Literature Mining**: Access text-mined associations from biomedical literature
3. **Evidence Integration**: Compare multiple lines of evidence for disease-gene links
4. **Network Analysis**: Build disease-gene networks for systems biology studies
5. **Validation**: Benchmark other disease-gene prediction methods
6. **Local Text Mining**: Use dictionary and tagger for custom analyses
