FooDB (The Food Database) is the world's largest and most comprehensive resource on food constituents, chemistry, and biology. It is maintained by The Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC), a nationally-funded research and core facility in Canada.

The database contains extensive data on food compounds, including their chemical properties, biological activities, dietary sources, and health effects. Each chemical entry in FooDB contains more than 100 separate data fields covering detailed compositional, biochemical, and physiological information obtained from the literature.

FooDB integrates information from multiple sources, linking food compound data to other relevant databases such as HMDB, PubChem, CHEBI, KEGG, and NCBI_Taxonomy. This integration provides a comprehensive view of food composition and its impact on nutrition and health.

The database offers information about both macronutrients and micronutrients, including many of the constituents that give foods their flavor, color, taste, texture, and aroma. It classifies food compounds based on their chemical nature and biological relevance, helping users better understand the role of these compounds in nutrition and health.

Users can browse or search FooDB by food source, name, descriptors, function, or concentrations. The database supports a wide range of search functionalities, allowing users to perform text, sequence, chemical structure, and relational queries.
