# OMIM

OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) is a comprehensive, expert-curated knowledgebase of human genes and genetic phenotypes with a focus on genotype–phenotype relationships. Access is provided via the public website and a REST API (registration required). Most bulk download files require registration; the mim2gene.txt mapping is publicly available. Please cite OMIM and relevant literature when using the resource.
