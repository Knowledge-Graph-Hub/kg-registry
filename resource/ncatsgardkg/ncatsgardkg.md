# NCATS GARD KG

The NCATS GARD Knowledge Graph (KG) is a comprehensive knowledge graph focused on rare diseases, developed by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). This resource integrates data from the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) and other sources to create a rich network of relationships between rare diseases, genes, drugs, and other biomedical entities.

The knowledge graph leverages advanced clustering and machine learning approaches to identify patterns and relationships that can inform rare disease research and drug discovery efforts. It provides a structured representation of rare disease knowledge that can be used to support translational research and precision medicine applications.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive integration of rare disease data from GARD and other sources
- Machine learning-enhanced clustering of diseases and therapeutic targets
- Support for drug discovery and repurposing efforts
- Structured knowledge representation suitable for computational analysis

## Applications

The NCATS GARD KG supports various research applications including:
- Rare disease drug discovery and repurposing
- Identification of disease-disease relationships
- Biomarker discovery for rare diseases
- Precision medicine approaches for rare disease patients

## Development

This resource is developed and maintained by researchers at NCATS as part of their mission to advance translational sciences and improve treatments for rare diseases.
