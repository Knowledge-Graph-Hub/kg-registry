# Complex Portal

## Overview

The Complex Portal is a comprehensive, manually curated resource of macromolecular complexes from key model organisms. It serves as an authoritative aggregator that combines expert manual curation with high-confidence machine-learning predictions to provide detailed annotations for protein complexes that have been experimentally characterized.

## Data Content

The Complex Portal defines complexes as assemblies of two or more proteins and/or nucleic acids that are stable enough to be reconstituted in vitro and have demonstrated specific molecular functions. The resource covers multiple organisms:

- **Human** (*Homo sapiens*) - Most comprehensive coverage
- **Mouse** (*Mus musculus*) - Key model organism
- **Yeast** (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) - Well-studied unicellular model
- **Fruit fly** (*Drosophila melanogaster*) - Developmental biology model
- **Worm** (*Caenorhabditis elegans*) - Simple multicellular model
- **E. coli** (*Escherichia coli*) - Bacterial model

### Complex Annotation Features

Each complex entry provides:

- **Protein composition** with UniProt identifiers and stoichiometry
- **Functional annotation** using Gene Ontology terms
- **Cellular localization** and tissue distribution
- **Structural information** and cross-references to PDB
- **Disease associations** and clinical relevance
- **Experimental evidence** with literature references
- **Complex assembly pathways** and regulatory mechanisms

### High-Confidence Predictions

In addition to manually curated complexes, the portal includes:

- **hu.MAP 3.0 predictions** - Machine learning-derived human protein complexes
- **MuSIC predictions** - Multi-species interaction complexes
- Quality scores and confidence metrics for computational predictions

## Data Formats and Access

### File Formats

1. **PSI-MI XML 2.5/3.0** - Proteomics Standards Initiative format with comprehensive metadata
2. **ComplexTAB** - Flat-file format designed for easy parsing and Excel compatibility
3. **Web Service API** - RESTful interface for programmatic access

### Data Organization

Data is systematically organized by:
- **Species-specific files** for targeted organism studies
- **Complete datasets** for comprehensive analyses
- **Monthly releases** with version control and change logs
- **FTP access** for bulk downloads and automated processing

## Applications

### Research Applications

- **Systems biology** modeling of cellular networks
- **Drug discovery** targeting specific protein complexes
- **Structural biology** studies of macromolecular assemblies
- **Proteomics** analysis of complex compositions
- **Disease research** investigating complex dysfunction

### Integration Partners

The Complex Portal integrates with and contributes to:

- **IntAct** molecular interaction database
- **UniProt** protein sequence and annotation
- **PDBe** structural biology database
- **Gene Ontology** functional annotation
- **Reactome** pathway database

## Quality Assurance

### Curation Standards

- Manual curation from peer-reviewed literature
- Expert biocurator review and validation
- Cross-referencing with multiple evidence sources
- Regular updates incorporating new experimental data
- Community feedback and correction mechanisms

### Data Reliability

- Experimental evidence requirements for all entries
- Confidence scoring for computational predictions
- Version tracking and change documentation
- Quality metrics and validation procedures
