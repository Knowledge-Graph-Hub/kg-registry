description: MetaCyc is a curated database of experimentally elucidated metabolic
  pathways from all domains of life. MetaCyc contains pathways involved in both primary
  and secondary metabolism, as well as associated metabolites, reactions, enzymes,
  and genes. The goal of MetaCyc is to catalog the universe of metabolism by storing
  a representative sample of each experimentally elucidated pathway.
