# CORUM - Comprehensive Resource of Mammalian Protein Complexes

CORUM is a manually curated database of experimentally characterized protein complexes from mammalian organisms. It serves as a comprehensive and high-quality resource for researchers studying protein-protein interactions, cellular functions, and disease mechanisms.

## Overview

The CORUM database focuses on protein complexes from human, mouse, and rat, with a particular emphasis on human complexes. The database is distinguished by its commitment to manual curation from scientific literature, ensuring high data quality. Every entry in CORUM is based on experimental evidence from published research papers, providing reliable information about the composition and function of protein complexes.

As of the 2023 update, CORUM contains:
- Over 4,700 protein complexes
- More than 3,300 different genes
- Approximately 20,000 protein-protein interactions

## Key Features

CORUM provides comprehensive information about each protein complex, including:

- Complex name and synonyms
- Organism source
- Protein composition (with UniProt IDs)
- Associated diseases
- Biological functions (GO terms)
- Cellular localization
- PubMed references to experimental evidence
- Tissue distribution
- Protein complex purification methods

## Data Sources and Curation

All entries in CORUM are manually extracted from scientific literature by expert curators. This manual curation approach ensures high-quality data and allows for the inclusion of detailed information that may not be captured by automated text mining approaches. The curation process focuses on:

1. Identifying experimentally verified protein complexes from peer-reviewed publications
2. Mapping protein components to standardized identifiers (UniProt)
3. Annotating complexes with functional information and disease associations
4. Cross-referencing with other databases and ontologies

## Applications

CORUM serves as a valuable resource for various research applications:

- **Proteomics**: Interpretation of mass spectrometry data and analysis of protein-protein interactions
- **Systems Biology**: Study of cellular pathways and network analysis
- **Disease Research**: Investigation of disease mechanisms and identification of therapeutic targets
- **Computational Biology**: Training and validation of protein interaction prediction algorithms
- **Functional Genomics**: Functional annotation of genes and proteins

## Data Access

CORUM data is freely available for academic and non-commercial use under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license. The database can be accessed through:

- Web interface at [https://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/](https://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/)
- Bulk downloads in various formats (PSI-MI XML, MITAB, plain text)
