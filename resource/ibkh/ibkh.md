---
The integrative Biomedical Knowledge Hub (iBKH) is a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph created by harmonizing and integrating information from diverse biomedical resources. It provides an efficient and effective way to manage abundant knowledge in biomedical and life science.

iBKH features:
- A comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph integrating information from multiple biomedical databases
- A web-based, user-friendly graphical portal for fast and interactive knowledge retrieval
- An efficient and scalable graph learning pipeline for discovering novel biomedical knowledge
- Application to computational in-silico drug repurposing, demonstrated with Alzheimer's disease as a proof of concept

The knowledge graph is publicly available and designed to facilitate biomedical discovery and translational research.
