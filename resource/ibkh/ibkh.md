# integrative Biomedical Knowledge Hub (iBKH)

## Overview

The integrative Biomedical Knowledge Hub (iBKH) is a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph (BKG) that harmonizes and integrates information from diverse biomedical resources. The knowledge graph was developed to efficiently manage the abundance of biomedical knowledge gained from biological experiments and clinical practices.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Integration**: Harmonizes data from multiple biomedical ontologies and databases including disease, gene, protein, drug, pathway, and phenotype information
- **Web-based Portal**: Provides a user-friendly graphical interface for fast and interactive knowledge retrieval
- **Graph Learning Pipeline**: Implements efficient and scalable graph learning methods for discovering novel biomedical knowledge
- **Drug Repurposing**: Demonstrates application in computational in-silico drug repurposing, including for Alzheimer's disease

## Data Sources

iBKH integrates information from various biomedical resources including:
- Disease ontologies
- Gene and protein databases
- Drug databases (e.g., DrugBank, CTD)
- Pathway databases (e.g., KEGG, Reactome)
- Phenotype databases
- Biomedical literature

## Applications

As a proof of concept, iBKH has been used for:
- Computational drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease
- Biomedical knowledge discovery
- Network-based biomedical analysis

## Citation

When using iBKH, please cite:
