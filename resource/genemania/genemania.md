description: GeneMANIA is a gene function prediction resource that integrates many types of
  functional association networks (co-expression, protein and genetic interactions, pathways,
  co-localization, and shared protein domains) and uses adaptive network weighting with label
  propagation to prioritize related genes and expand gene lists.

GeneMANIA helps predict the function of genes and gene sets by integrating heterogeneous
functional genomics data across organisms and returning an interactive network with
ranked related genes and per-dataset contribution weights.
