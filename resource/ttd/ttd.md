# Therapeutic Target Database

## Overview

The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) is a comprehensive aggregator providing specialized information about therapeutic protein and nucleic acid targets, their targeted diseases, pathway information, and corresponding drugs. TTD serves as an essential resource for drug discovery and development, facilitating target assessment, validation, and druggability evaluation.

## Mission and Scope

TTD's primary mission is to facilitate research and early development of targeted therapeutics by providing comprehensive druggability information for therapeutic targets. The database aggregates and integrates data from multiple sources including FDA approvals, clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov), pharmaceutical company pipeline reports, patent databases, and scientific literature.

## Database Content

### Targets and Drugs

As of the 2024 update, TTD contains:

- **3,730 therapeutic targets** categorized by development status:
  - 532 successful targets (targeted by FDA-approved drugs)
  - 1,442 clinical trial targets
  - 239 preclinical/patented targets
  - 1,517 literature-reported targets

- **39,862 drugs** across development stages:
  - 2,895 approved drugs
  - 11,796 clinical trial drugs
  - 5,041 preclinical/patented drugs
  - 20,130 experimental drugs

### Druggability Information

TTD 2024 introduces comprehensive druggability characteristics from three distinct perspectives:

#### 1. Molecular Interactions and Regulations

- **Ligand-Specific Binding Pockets**: Over 22,431 co-crystal structures providing drug binding pocket information for 1,237 targets, with residues interacting with drugs at distances <5Ã… highlighted
- **Protein-Protein Interaction Networks**: Network properties (degree, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, etc.) calculated for 2,163 targets based on a human PPI network of 9,309 proteins and 52,713 interactions
- **Microbiota-Drug Bidirectional Regulations**: 9,812 interactions between 663 drugs and 686 microbes across 20 phyla, describing how microbiota affects drug metabolism and how drugs regulate microbe abundance

#### 2. Human System Features

- **Target Similarity Profiles**: Similarity to human proteins outside target families calculated via BLAST (E-value <0.005) for 3,005 targets, helping assess off-target interactions
- **Pathway Involvements**: 241 life-essential KEGG pathways associated with 2,881 targets, indicating target positions in critical biological processes
- **Tissue/Organ Distributions**: Protein expression data across 32 human tissues for 2,001 targets, helping evaluate potential adverse drug reactions

#### 3. Cell-Based Expression Variations

- **Varied Expressions Across Cell Types**: Expression profiles for 2,845 targets across 1,742 cell types from 7,289 samples, covering 121 disease classes defined by WHO ICD-11
- **Exogenous Stimulus-Induced Differential Expression**: Expression changes induced by 625 exogenous factors (drugs, infections, environmental stimuli) for 2,862 targets across 313 cell lines
- **Endogenous Factor-Modified Expression**: Expression alterations by 447 endogenous factors (mutations, expression variations) for 2,841 targets across 198 cell lines

## Data Organization and Access

### Search and Browse Functions

TTD provides multiple search interfaces:
- Full-text search across targets and drugs
- Search by ICD-11 defined disease classes
- Biomarker search
- Drug scaffold search
- Batch search for multiple TTD IDs

### Downloadable Data

TTD offers comprehensive downloadable datasets including:

- **Target Information**: UniProt IDs, sequences (FASTA), pathway data (KEGG and WikiPathways) for all targets or filtered by development status
- **Drug Information**: Structures (SDF format), SMILES/InChI representations, biologic drug sequences, cross-references to public databases
- **Mapping Data**: Target-disease, drug-disease, biomarker-disease, target-drug, and target-compound activity mappings
- **Drug Combinations**: Synergistic, additive, and antagonistic drug combination data with mechanistic classifications
- **Synonym Data**: Comprehensive synonyms for drugs and small molecules

## Key Features and Updates

### 2024 Update Highlights

The TTD 2024 update significantly expanded druggability information:

- Nine categories of druggability characteristics collected via systematic review
- Druggability data organized into three perspectives: molecular, system, and cellular
- Batch search functionality for uploading lists of TTD IDs
- Full download capability for all search results
- Enhanced cross-linking to pathway databases

### Historical Development

TTD has undergone continuous enhancement since 2002:

- **2022**: Added structure-based activity landscapes, prodrug information, co-target data
- **2020**: Integrated target regulators (microRNAs, transcription factors), patented agents with activity values
- **2018**: Incorporated differential expression profiles in patients vs. healthy individuals, multitarget drug combinations
- **2016**: Added pathway cross-links for targets and drugs
- **2014**: Introduced biomarkers and drug scaffolds
- **2012**: Added target validation information and QSAR models
- **2010**: Included clinical trial drugs and similarity search

## Applications and Impact

TTD data has been widely adopted for:

- **Drug Repurposing**: Tools like LigAdvisor and DrugRep utilize TTD data
- **Target Discovery**: Servers like CoVex and DeepCancerMap leverage TTD information
- **Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction**: Systems like MEDICASCY and H-RACS use TTD data
- **Scientific Research**: Hundreds of studies use TTD for genetic variant-disease associations, molecular characteristics of infections, target variability, and antifungal therapy discovery

## Technical Infrastructure

TTD is maintained by the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Zhejiang University (China) in collaboration with the Department of Pharmacy at the National University of Singapore. The database is freely accessible without login requirements at https://idrblab.org/ttd/ and supports research and educational purposes.

## Data Quality and Curation

Target and drug data in TTD undergo rigorous validation:

- Approved drugs collected from authoritative FDA publications
- Clinical trial drugs sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov, PhRMA reports, and company pipelines
- Preclinical/patented drugs extracted from company reports and patent databases
- Target status determined by highest drug development status
- Target validation requires demonstrated functional roles in disease and drug modulation capability

## Funding and Support

TTD development is supported by:
- Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province
- Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Research Center of Future Digital Healthcare
- Alibaba Cloud
- Information Technology Center of Zhejiang University

## Future Directions

TTD continues to expand its coverage of druggability characteristics and aims to facilitate the exploration of novel targets and discovery of new therapeutics. Future updates will focus on:
- Integration of additional single-cell expression data
- Expanded coverage of drug-target-disease relationships
- Enhanced computational tools for druggability assessment
- Improved cross-referencing with other biomedical databases
