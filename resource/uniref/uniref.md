description: UniRef (Universal Protein Resource Reference Clusters) provides clustered sets of protein sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase and selected UniParc records to obtain complete coverage. UniRef100 combines identical sequences and sub-fragments into a single UniRef entry, UniRef90 clusters sequences with 90% sequence identity, and UniRef50 clusters sequences with 50% sequence identity, providing speed and coverage tradeoffs for similarity searches.
