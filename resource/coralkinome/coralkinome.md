# CoralKinome

## Overview

CoralKinome is a specialized database and resource dedicated to protein kinases in coral species. Protein kinases play crucial roles in cellular signaling, stress responses, and symbiotic relationships in corals, making them important targets for understanding coral biology, bleaching responses, and conservation strategies.

## Key Features

- **Coral-Specific Kinase Sequences**: Curated collection of kinase genes from coral genomes
- **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Evolutionary relationships of coral kinases
- **Functional Annotations**: Predicted and experimentally validated kinase functions
- **Comparative Genomics**: Cross-species comparisons of kinase repertoires
- **Symbiosis-Related Kinases**: Focus on kinases involved in coral-algae symbiosis

## Content Coverage

### Coral Species
- Scleractinian (reef-building) corals
- Soft corals and sea anemones (cnidarians)
- Multiple coral species with sequenced genomes

### Kinase Information
- Sequence data
- Domain architecture
- Phylogenetic classification
- Expression patterns
- Functional predictions

## Applications

- **Coral Biology**: Understanding coral physiology and development
- **Climate Change Research**: Identifying stress response pathways
- **Bleaching Studies**: Kinases involved in thermal stress and bleaching
- **Symbiosis Research**: Signaling in coral-dinoflagellate relationships
- **Conservation**: Molecular markers for coral health assessment
- **Drug Discovery**: Kinases as potential targets for coral disease treatment

## Integration

CoralKinome data is integrated into broader kinase resources including:
- KinAce (kinase-substrate interaction portal)
- Kinase family databases
- Coral genomic resources
- Marine biology databases

## Importance

Corals are critical ecosystem engineers facing threats from:
- Ocean warming and acidification
- Coral bleaching events
- Disease outbreaks
- Pollution

Understanding coral kinomes contributes to:
- Identifying resilience mechanisms
- Predicting stress responses
- Developing conservation strategies
- Understanding symbiotic breakdown

## Related Resources

- **ReefGenomics**: Coral and symbiont genomic resources
- **KinBase**: Kinase classification and evolution
- **CoralTraits**: Coral trait database
- **NCBI Coral Genomes**: Genomic sequences

## Community

CoralKinome supports the coral research community by providing specialized kinase information relevant to cnidarian biology and marine ecosystem health.
