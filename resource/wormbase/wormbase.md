# WormBase

## Overview

WormBase is a comprehensive biological database and online resource for the biology and genome of the nematode model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* and related nematode species. The database integrates genomic sequences, gene structures, functional annotations, genetic and physical maps, gene expression patterns, protein-protein interactions, RNAi phenotypes, mutant alleles, and curated literature.

## Primary Organism

WormBase primarily focuses on *Caenorhabditis elegans* but also includes data for:
- *C. briggsae*, *C. remanei*, *C. brenneri*, *C. angaria*, *C. japonica*
- *Pristionchus pacificus*
- Parasitic nematodes including *Haemonchus contortus*, *Brugia malayi*, *Meloidogyne hapla*, and *Meloidogyne incognita*

## Data Content

WormBase comprises:
- Annotated genomes with hand-curated gene structures
- ~20,500 protein-coding genes and ~16,000 non-coding genes for C. elegans
- Gene family classifications and orthology relationships
- Comprehensive phenotype and allele information
- Whole-genome RNAi screens
- Gene expression profiles from microarrays, RNA-Seq, and GFP reporter studies
- Complete cell lineage and nervous system wiring diagram
- Protein-protein interaction networks
- Genetic regulatory relationships
- Searchable bibliography of C. elegans research

## Tools & Access

- **Web Portal**: Interactive browsing and search interface
- **GBrowse**: Genome browser for visualizing genomic features
- **WormMine**: InterMine-based data mining facility for complex queries
- **REST API**: Programmatic access to all WormBase data
- **Textpresso**: Literature text mining and search
- **FTP Downloads**: Bulk data files including genome assemblies and annotations
- **WormBase ParaSite**: Sub-portal for parasitic helminth genomes

## Management & Funding

WormBase is a collaboration among the European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Washington University in St. Louis, and California Institute of Technology. Supported by the National Institutes of Health (P41-HG002223) and the British Medical Research Council.

## Part of Alliance

WormBase is a founding member of the Alliance of Genome Resources, which integrates data across model organism databases.
