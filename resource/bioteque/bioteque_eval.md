# Evaluation for bioteque

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Access Level and Types | Y (Bioteque provides node-type-specific embeddings for 11 of the node types in its graph, along with downloadable sets of those individual sets of nodes mapped to their representations in the embeddings.) |
| Provenance of Nodes and Edges | Y (see https://bioteque.irbbarcelona.org/sources) |
| Documented standards, schema, construction | Y (the provided node files are provided as TSVs, though assembly of a full KG would require running the graph assembly code. It appears that the assembly code also produces nodes and edges in a TSV format.) |
| Update frequency and versioning | N |
| Evaluation - Metrics and Fitness for Purpose | Y (Examples of use are described in the 2022 Nat Comm paper; an example of generating predictions for drug repurposing is provided.) |
