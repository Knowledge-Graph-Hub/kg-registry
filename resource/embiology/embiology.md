description: EmBiology is a commercial, web-based knowledge graph platform from Elsevier
  that surfaces biological relationships across entities such as genes, proteins,
  diseases, cells, and more. EmBiology connects 1.4 million entities via 15.7 million
  relationships and provides 87.2 million referenced facts (figures reported by Elsevier),
  with weekly updates and annual rescans of the corpus. It uses NLP (including the
  TERMite engine) and expert curation to extract and quality-control relationships
  from full-text scientific literature and other sources, and offers interactive visualization
  (e.g., Sankey diagrams) and filtering to support discovery and decision-making in
  drug research and biology.
