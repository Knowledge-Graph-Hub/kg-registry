The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) aims to facilitate better integration, and reuse 
of Common Fund data to accelerate discoveries in biomedical research.The Data Distillery 
project aims to integrate summarized (“distilled”) Common Fund data within a knowledge 
graph. The purpose of the Data Distillery Knowledge Graph (DDKG) is to link multiple 
sources of expertly curated data, thus providing data integration across multiple 
Common Fund data coordinating centers (DCCs). The summarized data are provided by 
participating DCCs and funded as part of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) project. 
The DDKG schema is based on the Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG) which 
originates from the Unifield Medical Language System (UMLS). The UBKG supports the 
DDKG with over 180 different ontologies and standards supporting the Common Fund 
data that either are native to UMLS or were explicitly added to support biomolecular 
data. The DDKG can be used to create simple to complex queries, and use the results 
for a range of different applications related to the use of Common Fund data
