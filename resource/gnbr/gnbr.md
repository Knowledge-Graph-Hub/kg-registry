	The Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR) is a large-scale
	biomedical knowledge graph derived from literature. GNBR uses text mining of
	PubMed abstracts to extract typed relationships between genes, diseases and
	drugs/chemicals, organizing them into semantic themes suitable for link
	prediction and downstream applications such as drug repurposing. GNBR has been
	widely used as a text-derived KG resource and is available via GitHub and Zenodo.
