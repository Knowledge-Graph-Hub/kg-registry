description: PathWhiz is a web-based pathway drawing and visualization tool designed for creating colorful, visually pleasing, and biologically accurate pathway diagrams that are machine-readable and interactive. PathWhiz supports a high level of biological detail including metabolites (with automated structure generation), protein complexes (with quaternary structures, covalent modifications, and cofactors), nucleic acids, membranes, subcellular structures, cells, tissues, and organs. PathWhiz has been used to generate over 700 pathway diagrams for popular databases including HMDB, DrugBank, and PathBank, and supports export to BioPAX, SBGN-ML, SBML, and PWML formats as well as high-resolution images.
