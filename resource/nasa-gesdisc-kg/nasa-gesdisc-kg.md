description: The NASA Knowledge Graph Dataset is an expansive graph-based dataset
  designed to integrate and interconnect information about satellite datasets, scientific
  publications, instruments, platforms, projects, data centers, and science keywords.
  This knowledge graph is particularly focused on datasets managed by NASA's Distributed
  Active Archive Centers (DAACs), which are NASA's data repositories responsible for
  archiving and distributing scientific data. In addition to NASA DAACs, the graph
  includes datasets from 184 data providers worldwide, including various government
  agencies and academic institutions.
