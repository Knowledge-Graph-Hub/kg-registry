# MedGen

MedGen is NCBI's portal to information about conditions, phenotypes, and findings in humans related to medical genetics. It serves as a comprehensive aggregator that organizes and integrates information from multiple authoritative sources, providing a unified view of genetic conditions and their relationships.

## Overview

MedGen includes diseases such as Mendelian disorders, multi-factorial disorders, chronic disease susceptibilities, somatic phenotypes, and pharmacogenetic responses. The database also includes infectious disease terms to support submitters of the NIH Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) and clinicians looking for tests and terms related to infectious agents in human samples.

## Core Concept

Terms from various sources including GTR and ClinVar submissions, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Mondo Disease Ontology, rare disease terms from Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), and other sources are integrated into unique concepts. Each concept is assigned a distinct identifier called the Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) and a preferred name.

## Content Integration

The core content of a concept record includes:

- **Names and Identifiers**: Names used by different databases with links to external resources (ontologies such as HPO, ORDO, and Mondo)
- **Modes of Inheritance**: Information about genetic inheritance patterns
- **Clinical Features**: Associated phenotypes and clinical characteristics
- **Genomic Location**: Map location of the loci affecting the phenotype
- **External Resources**: Links to resources for clinicians (OMIM), customers (MedlinePlus), genetic tests (GTR), medical literature (GeneReviews, PubMed), and molecular resources (ClinVar, RefSeqGene)

## Data Sources

MedGen aggregates data from multiple authoritative sources with varying update frequencies:

| Source | Update Frequency | Primary Data Types | Coverage |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| UMLS | 2x/year | CUI, descriptions, name and ID | 96% |
| HPO | Monthly | Name and ID, Phenotype:Disease relationships | 8% |
| Mondo | Monthly | Name, ID; Orphanet and GARD | 10% |
| Orphanet (ORDO) | Monthly | Name, ID, Mode of Inheritance | 4% |
| OMIM | Daily | Name, ID, Gene:Disease, description | 5% |
| GeneReviews | Weekly | Name, Gene:Disease, description | 0.4% |
| PharmGKB | Monthly | Drug name, ID, Drug:Gene relationships | 0.5% |
| MedGen (internal) | Daily | Name, CN CUI, Drug:Disease, Disease:Disease | 2% |
| NCBI Gene | Daily | Gene symbol, chromosome location | N/A |

*Note: MedGen terms can have one or more external identifiers/sources mapped. Percentages are averaged from data analyzed in 2024.*

## Concept Unique Identifiers

MedGen primarily uses CUIs from the UMLS dataset. When a CUI cannot be found in UMLS to match a record in MedGen, an NCBI-generated CUI is provided instead. These begin with "CN" to clarify they are not UMLS-provided CUIs (which all begin with "C"). CN-type CUIs may be created from submissions in the NIH Genetic Testing Registry or ClinVar that do not match a record in UMLS.

## Pharmacogenomics

MedGen provides standardized terminology for pharmacogenomics, describing the interaction between an individual's genetic code and medication response. Using data from PharmGKB, MedGen creates disease records describing abnormal responses to drugs driven by genetic or environmental factors. These terms are created and maintained by MedGen with links to expert clinical recommendations, FDA-approved drug labels, and PharmGKB pages.

## Data Processing and Curation

MedGen employs both automated and manual curation processes:

### Automated Alignment
When new versions of source data become available, automated pipelines download and process the data, making local copies. The relevant data is subset, existing terms are updated as needed, and new terms are added. Mapping is done between identifiers or concept preferred names, or both, depending on the data sources involved.

### Manual Curation
The manual curation process follows a standard decision tree to evaluate source terms and potential matches in MedGen. When source data is unclear, curators contact the source to clarify term scope and meaning. MedGen terms are curated to align with sources by splitting or merging terms or creating novel MedGen records as needed.

## Related NCBI Resources

MedGen integrates with several NCBI resources:
- **ClinVar**: Database of genomic variation and its relationship to human health
- **Gene**: NCBI's gene-centered database
- **Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)**: Registry of genetic tests
- **GeneReviews**: Expert-authored disease descriptions
- **RefSeqGene**: Reference standard sequences for human genes
- **Medical Genetics Summaries**: Information about genetic conditions

## FTP Data Files

MedGen provides extensive downloadable data through its FTP site, including:
- **Rich Rich Format (RRF) files**: Core database files with concept names, definitions, relationships, attributes, and semantic types
- **Mapping files**: ID mappings to external sources, HPO, OMIM, and other databases
- **History files**: Tracking changes to CUIs and external term mappings
- **Literature links**: Connections between concepts and PubMed articles
- **CSV exports**: Alternative format data files for easier processing

All major data files are provided with gzip compression to reduce file sizes while maintaining complete data integrity.
