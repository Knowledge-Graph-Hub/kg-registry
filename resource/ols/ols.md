# Ontology Lookup Service

## Overview

The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) is a comprehensive repository for biomedical ontologies maintained by EMBL-EBI. It provides a single point of access to the latest versions of numerous biomedical ontologies, making it easier for researchers to browse, search, and access ontology data. OLS supports both human browsing through its web interface and programmatic access through its REST API.

## Data Content

OLS aggregates and provides access to numerous biomedical ontologies from various sources, including:

- **Anatomy and Development**: Uberon, Cell Ontology (CL), and others
- **Diseases**: Disease Ontology (DOID), Mondo, Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
- **Chemistry**: ChEBI
- **Molecular Biology**: Gene Ontology (GO), Sequence Ontology (SO)
- **And many more** biomedical domain ontologies

The service provides:
- Latest ontology versions with automatic updates
- Cross-references between ontologies
- Links to external databases
- Ontology metadata and provenance information
- Term definitions, synonyms, and hierarchical relationships

## Key Features

- **Web Interface**: User-friendly browsing and searching with filtering options
- **REST API**: Comprehensive programmatic access to all ontology data
- **Search Capabilities**: Full-text search with exact match and obsolete term options
- **Cross-References**: Linked data between different ontologies and external databases
- **Multiple Formats**: Data available in JSON, Neo4j, Solr, and SSSOM formats
- **Regular Updates**: Continuous integration of latest ontology versions
- **SSSOM Mappings**: Standardized ontology-to-ontology mappings

## Access Methods

- **Web Portal**: Browse and search through https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/
- **REST API**: Programmatic access documented at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/api-docs
- **FTP Downloads**: Data dumps available at https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/spot/ols/
- **Database Exports**: Neo4j and Solr databases for local deployment
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI integration

## Data Formats

OLS provides data in multiple formats:

1. **JSON**: Internal ontology representation (~50 GB uncompressed)
2. **Linked JSON**: With cross-references added (~150 GB uncompressed)
3. **Neo4j**: Graph database format (requires Neo4j community 2025.03.0)
4. **Solr**: Search index database (requires Solr 9.0.0)
5. **SSSOM**: Standard Simple Standard for Ontology Mappings format

## Use Cases

1. **Ontology Browsing**: Explore biomedical ontologies interactively
2. **Programmatic Integration**: Access ontology data in applications via API
3. **Local Deployment**: Set up local OLS instances for development
4. **Mapping Analysis**: Study cross-ontology mappings and relationships
5. **Data Annotation**: Use ontology terms for standardized data annotation
6. **AI Integration**: Access ontology knowledge through MCP server

## Related Services

The SPOT team also provides complementary services:

- **OxO**: Cross-ontology mapping service between terms from different ontologies
- **ZOOMA**: Service to assist in mapping data to ontologies in OLS

# Ontology Lookup Service API

## Overview

The OLS REST API provides access to key biological data from OLS. The services provide a unified interface to query information about ontology terms from GO (the Gene Ontology) and ECO (the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology), Gene Ontology annotations from the EBI's GOA database, and gene products (proteins from UniProt, RNA from RNAcentral and complexes from ComplexPortal).
