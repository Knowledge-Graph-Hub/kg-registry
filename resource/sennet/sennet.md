# SenNet - Cellular Senescence Network

## Overview

The Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet) is an NIH Common Fund program that aims to comprehensively identify and characterize senescent cells across the human lifespan and in various disease states.

Launched in 2021, SenNet develops and applies cutting-edge technologies to create spatial molecular maps of senescent cells in human tissues, advancing understanding of how these cells contribute to aging and age-related diseases.

## Key Features

- **Senescence Biomarkers**: Development and validation of markers for detecting senescent cells
- **Multi-Omics Profiling**: Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics of senescent cells
- **Spatial Mapping**: Tissue-level spatial distribution of senescent cells
- **Technology Development**: Novel methods for senescence detection and characterization
- **Public Data**: Open access to datasets, protocols, and analysis tools
- **Cross-Tissue Studies**: Comprehensive mapping across multiple human tissues

## Research Applications

- Aging biology research
- Age-related disease mechanisms
- Therapeutic target identification
- Senolytic drug development
- Biomarker discovery
- Understanding tissue-specific aging
