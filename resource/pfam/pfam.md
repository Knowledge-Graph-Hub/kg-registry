Pfam is a large collection of protein families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Proteins are generally composed of one or more functional regions, commonly termed domains. The presence of different domains in varying combinations in different proteins gives rise to the diverse repertoire of proteins found in nature. Identifying the domains present in a protein can provide insights into its function.

Each Pfam family, usually referred to as a Pfam-A entry, consists of a curated seed alignment containing a small set of representative members of the family, profile HMMs built from the seed alignment, and an automatically generated full alignment, which contains all detectable protein sequences belonging to the family, as defined by profile HMM searches of primary sequence databases.

Pfam entries are classified into several types:
- Family: A collection of related proteins
- Domain: A structural unit that can be found in multiple protein contexts
- Repeat: A short unit that is unstable in isolation but forms a stable structure when multiple copies are present
- Motif: A short unit found outside globular domains
- Coiled-coil: A region that forms a coiled-coil structure
- Disordered: A region that is disordered in the native state

Pfam also groups related entries into clans, which are collections of Pfam entries related by sequence, structure, or profile HMM. This is particularly useful for capturing relationships between divergent families that may have a common evolutionary origin.

Pfam version 37.0 is based on UniProt release 2023_05. The database is now maintained as part of the InterPro database at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). Pfam is powered by the HMMER3 package developed by Sean Eddy's group at HHMI/Harvard University.

The database is freely available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license and can be accessed through the InterPro website or downloaded from the FTP site.
