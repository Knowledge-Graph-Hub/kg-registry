description: REDIportal is a specialized database of A-to-I RNA editing events, integrating ~16 million sites from GTEx and TCGA with links to Ensembl, RNAcentral, UniProt, and PRIDE. The portal supports search by genomic position, sample (GTEx/TCGA), dsRNA modules, and gene view, and reports AEI/REI indices and a deep-learning-based reliability score (REDInet).

# REDIportal

REDIportal is a curated knowledgebase of A-to-I RNA editing sites. It integrates data from GTEx and TCGA, provides AEI and REI activity metrics, dsRNA modules, and deep-learning reliability scoring (REDInet), with rich cross-links to ELIXIR core resources. See the portal and the downloads page for access.
