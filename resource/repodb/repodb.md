# RepoDB: A Standard Database for Drug Repositioning

RepoDB is a comprehensive database designed to support drug repositioning research by providing a standard set of drug repositioning successes and failures. This resource enables fair and reproducible benchmarking of computational repositioning methods by offering curated data on approved drugs, their therapeutic indications, and clinical trial outcomes.

## Overview

Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing) involves finding new therapeutic uses for existing approved drugs. RepoDB addresses the critical need for standardized datasets in this field by providing:

- **Repositioning Successes**: Drugs that have been successfully repositioned for new indications
- **Repositioning Failures**: Clinical trials that did not result in successful repositioning
- **Approved Drug-Indication Pairs**: Current therapeutic uses of approved drugs
- **Clinical Trial Data**: Outcomes from ClinicalTrials.gov

## Data Sources and Methodology

RepoDB integrates data from two primary sources:

### DrugCentral
- Comprehensive database of approved drugs and their indications
- Provides information on drug properties, targets, and therapeutic uses
- Ensures data quality and standardization

### ClinicalTrials.gov
- Clinical trial registry maintained by the NIH
- Source of clinical trial outcomes and repositioning attempts
- Provides data on both successful and failed repositioning efforts

## Key Features

### Web Interface Functionality
- **Drug-centric searching**: Explore repositioning data by specific drugs
- **Disease-centric searching**: Find repositioning opportunities by therapeutic area
- **Interactive visualizations**: Explore data characteristics and relationships
- **Full dataset download**: Access complete RepoDB data for computational analysis

### Data Characteristics
- Curated drug repositioning successes and failures
- Standardized drug and disease identifiers
- Clinical trial phase information
- Temporal data on drug approvals and repositioning events

## Applications

### Research Applications
- **Computational Method Benchmarking**: Standard dataset for evaluating repositioning algorithms
- **Drug Discovery**: Identify potential repositioning opportunities
- **Clinical Research**: Understand patterns in successful and failed repositioning
- **Pharmacovigilance**: Study drug safety across different indications

### Educational Use
- Teaching drug repositioning concepts
- Demonstrating computational drug discovery methods
- Case studies in pharmaceutical research

## Data Updates

RepoDB is regularly updated to maintain current and comprehensive coverage:

- **Original Version (2017)**: Developed by Harvard School of Medicine Patel Group
- **2020 Update**: Enhanced by University of New Mexico with updated sources
- **2023 Update**: Latest version with current DrugCentral, AACT, and UMLS data
