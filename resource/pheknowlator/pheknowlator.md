PheKnowLator (Phenotype Knowledge Translator) or pkt_kg is the first fully customizable 
knowledge graph (KG) construction framework enabling users to build complex KGs that 
are Semantic Web compliant and amenable to automatic Web Ontology Language (OWL) 
reasoning, generate contemporary property graphs, and are importable by todayâ€™s popular 
graph toolkits.
