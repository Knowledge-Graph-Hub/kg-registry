# Zasha Weinberg Data

## Overview

The Zasha Weinberg Data (ZWD) repository is a collection of RNA sequence and structure data maintained by Zasha Weinberg. This data source provides curated information about RNA elements, particularly focusing on regulatory RNAs, riboswitches, and other structured non-coding RNA elements. The data is hosted on Bitbucket and contributes to the comprehensive RNAcentral non-coding RNA sequence database.

## Scope and Content

The repository contains RNA-related data derived from computational and comparative genomics analyses. As a contributor to RNAcentral, ZWD provides specialized RNA sequence and annotation data that complements other expert databases in the RNAcentral consortium. The focus is on structured RNA elements identified through computational methods and comparative sequence analysis.

## Data Organization

The data is organized in the Bitbucket repository at https://bitbucket.org/zashaw/zashaweinbergdata/ and is structured to support computational analysis of RNA sequences and structures. The repository serves as both a standalone resource and a data source for the broader RNAcentral aggregator.

## Integration with RNAcentral

ZWD data is integrated into RNAcentral, the international non-coding RNA sequence database. Through this integration, ZWD sequences and annotations become searchable and accessible via RNAcentral's web portal, REST API, FTP archive, and public PostgreSQL database. This ensures broad accessibility and interoperability with other RNA databases.

## Access and Availability

The primary access point for ZWD data is through the Bitbucket repository. Additionally, ZWD contributions can be accessed through RNAcentral's various interfaces, providing multiple pathways for researchers to utilize this data in their work.

## Research Applications

The data is particularly relevant for researchers studying:
- RNA structure and function
- Regulatory RNA elements
- Riboswitch mechanisms
- Comparative genomics of RNA
- Non-coding RNA identification and characterization

## Citation

When using data from this repository, please cite the Bitbucket repository and acknowledge the contribution to RNAcentral where applicable.
