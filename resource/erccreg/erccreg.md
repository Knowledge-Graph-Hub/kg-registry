# ERCC Regulatory Element Dataset

The ERCC Regulatory Element Dataset (erccreg) is part of the research output from the NIH Common Fund's Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium (ERCC), which explores the biology and function of extracellular RNA (exRNA).

## Overview

Extracellular RNA was once thought to exist in a stable form only inside cells, where it served as an intermediate in the translation from genes to proteins. However, research has revealed that RNAs can play a role in a variety of complex cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication. The ERCC Regulatory Element Dataset focuses on the regulatory elements and mechanisms associated with exRNA function.

## Research Context

This dataset is part of the broader ERCC initiative which aims to:

1. Discover fundamental biological principles about the mechanisms of exRNA generation, secretion, and transport
2. Identify and develop a catalog of exRNA found in normal human body fluids
3. Investigate the potential for using exRNAs in the clinic as therapeutic molecules or biomarkers of disease

## Data Access

The ERCC Regulatory Element dataset is referenced by other resources in the knowledge graph registry, but access to the primary data may be restricted. Interested researchers should contact the ERCC directly via the exRNA portal for information on data availability and access procedures.
