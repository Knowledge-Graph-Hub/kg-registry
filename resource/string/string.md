# STRING - Protein-Protein Interaction Networks

STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The database contains information from numerous sources, including experimental repositories, computational prediction methods, and public text collections.

## Overview

The STRING database currently covers:
- 59,309,604 proteins from 12,535 organisms
- Over 20 billion interactions
- Confidence scores for all protein interactions

## Data Sources

STRING integrates and scores interactions from five main sources:
1. **Genomic Context Predictions**: Interactions predicted from genome analysis
2. **High-throughput Lab Experiments**: Experimentally determined interactions
3. **(Conserved) Co-Expression**: Proteins that show similar expression patterns
4. **Automated Textmining**: Interactions extracted from scientific literature
5. **Previous Knowledge in Databases**: Curated interactions from existing databases

## Access and Usage

STRING data is available through multiple formats:
- Web interface for interactive visualization and analysis
- Downloadable datasets in various formats (TSV, SQL dumps)
- REST API for programmatic access
- Cytoscape plugin for network analysis

All data in STRING is freely available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.
