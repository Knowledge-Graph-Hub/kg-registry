# NIH Reporter

NIH Reporter (RePORTER - RePORT Expenditures and Results) is a comprehensive data source that provides access to information about NIH-funded research projects and their outcomes. As part of the Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) suite, it serves as the primary electronic repository for NIH research funding data, supporting transparency and accountability in biomedical research funding.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Research Project Database
- Contains records of NIH-funded research projects since fiscal year 1985
- Covers both intramural (conducted within NIH) and extramural (external institutions) research
- Includes grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other funding mechanisms
- Provides detailed project information including abstracts, aims, and funding amounts

### Advanced Search Capabilities
- Quick search functionality for broad queries across all fields
- Advanced search with configurable filters for precise project discovery
- Search by principal investigator, institution, project number, or keywords
- Geographic search capabilities for projects by state or region
- Fiscal year filtering for temporal analysis of funding patterns

### Publications and Patents Tracking
- Links NIH-funded projects to resulting publications in PubMed
- Tracks patents and intellectual property arising from NIH funding
- Provides impact metrics and citation tracking for research outcomes
- Enables assessment of research productivity and translation
