description: "PathoPhenoDB is a database of human pathogens, the diseases and phenotypes they elicit in human organisms, and information related to drug treatments and mechanisms of drug resistance. Specifically, PathoPhenoDB contains associations between pathogens and diseases, between pathogens and phenotypes, between drugs that are approved to treat particular pathogens, and it identifies genes or proteins within pathogens that can convey resistance to particular drugs."
