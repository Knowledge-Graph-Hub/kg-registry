description: 'Mechanistic Repositioning Network with Indications (MIND) is a knowledge
  graph incorporating two biomedical resources: MechRepoNet and DrugCentral. MechRepoNet
  is a knowledge graph comprising of 18 biomedical resources that reflects and expands
  on important drug mechanism relationships identified from a curated biomedical drug
  mechanism dataset. MIND was created by mapping DrugCentral edges to existing MechRepoNet
  nodes through the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and Medical Subject Headings
  (MeSH). The MIND training set has a total of 9,651,040 edges.'

MIND (Mechanistic Repositioning Network with Indications) is a knowledge graph that combines MechRepoNet, a graph comprising 18 biomedical resources, with DrugCentral indications data. MechRepoNet contains 9,652,116 edges and 250,035 nodes covering drug mechanisms, while DrugCentral contributes 5,379 indication edges representing relationships between 1,308 unique compounds and 1,030 unique diseases. The resulting MIND knowledge graph contains 9,651,040 edges in its training set and is designed to support drug repositioning research through knowledge graph embeddings.
