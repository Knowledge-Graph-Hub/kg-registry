# PheWAS Catalog

The PheWAS Catalog is a comprehensive aggregator of phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) that systematically analyzes associations between genetic variants and a wide range of phenotypes derived from electronic medical records (EMRs). This resource combines genetic data with clinical phenotypes to enable discovery of genetic associations across the phenome.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Genetic-Phenotype Associations
- Contains PheWAS results for over 3,144 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog
- Analyzes 1,358 EMR-derived phenotypes for each genetic variant
- Includes data from 13,835 European-ancestry individuals across five eMERGE network sites
- Provides systematic comparison between PheWAS and traditional GWAS results

### Phecode System
- Uses standardized Phecode mapping system to translate ICD codes into phenotypes
- Phecode Map 1.2 covers 1,866 phenotypes based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes
- Extended Phecode Map X includes 3,612 phenotype groupings based on ICD-10
- Enables consistent phenotype definitions across different healthcare systems

### Validation and Replication
- Successfully replicated 66% (51/77) of sufficiently powered prior GWAS associations
- Identified 210/751 associations from all prior GWAS studies
- Discovered 63 potentially pleiotropic associations with genome-wide significance
- Provides independent validation cohort results for novel associations

## Data Sources

### Electronic Medical Records
- eMERGE (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics) network data
- Vanderbilt DNA biobank (BioVU) with linked EMR data
- Multiple healthcare institutions contributing phenotype data
- Standardized phenotype extraction and coding procedures

### Genetic Data
- NHGRI GWAS Catalog variants as of April 2012
- High-quality genotyped and imputed SNPs
- Population-stratified genetic association results
- Quality control and validation of genetic variants

### Clinical Phenotypes
- ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes from EMRs
- Laboratory values and clinical measurements
- Medication prescriptions and procedures
- Longitudinal clinical data spanning multiple visits

## Applications

### Drug Discovery and Repurposing
- Identification of pleiotropic genetic effects for drug target validation
- Discovery of unexpected phenotype associations for drug repurposing
- Safety signal detection through genetic association patterns
- Biomarker identification for drug response prediction

### Precision Medicine
- Genetic risk prediction across multiple phenotypes
- Personalized disease risk assessment using genetic profiles
- Clinical decision support based on genetic associations
- Population-specific genetic risk stratification

### Genomic Medicine Research
- Hypothesis generation for novel genetic associations
- Validation platform for GWAS findings in clinical populations
- Cross-phenotype genetic correlation analysis
- Pleiotropy detection and characterization

### Clinical Phenotyping
- Standardization of EMR-derived phenotype definitions
- Validation of electronic phenotype algorithms
- Cross-institutional phenotype harmonization
- Quality assessment of clinical data extraction

## Technical Implementation
The PheWAS Catalog aggregates data through systematic analysis pipelines that process EMR data, apply Phecode mappings, perform genetic association testing, and provide statistical validation. The resource includes web-based tools for interactive exploration and programmatic access through R packages and APIs for computational workflows.
