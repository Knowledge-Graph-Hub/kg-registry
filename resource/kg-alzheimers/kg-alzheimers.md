KG-Alzheimers is a knowledge graph created in collaboration between Lawrence Berkeley National
Lab and Washington University, designed to integrate data related to Alzheimer's 
disease. The purpose is to support use cases including retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and the creation of an AI-assistant. It is built with a strong emphasis on provenance,
transparency, and interoperability with existing biomedical knowledge graphs. Learn more
about the project and its developments on our [documentation pages](https://kghub.org/kg-alzheimers/).
