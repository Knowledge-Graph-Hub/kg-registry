# GeneProf

## Overview

GeneProf was a database resource focused on gene expression profiles and functional genomics data. It aimed to provide researchers with access to curated gene expression information to support functional genomics studies and biological discovery.

## Activity Status

The GeneProf resource is currently inactive. The underlying database is throwing 404 errors, indicating the service is no longer accessible. No recent updates or alternative access methods are available.

## Historical Context

GeneProf represented an effort to aggregate and provide access to gene expression data, which is valuable for:
- Understanding gene function
- Identifying co-expressed genes
- Studying tissue-specific expression patterns
- Comparative expression analysis

## Alternative Resources

For gene expression data and profiles, consider:
- **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)**: NCBI's repository for expression data
- **Expression Atlas**: EMBL-EBI's gene expression resource
- **GTEx**: Genotype-Tissue Expression project
- **Human Protein Atlas**: Tissue and cell expression data
- **ARCHS4**: Massive gene expression dataset

## Information Resource ID

This resource has the Information Resource identifier: `infores:geneprof`
