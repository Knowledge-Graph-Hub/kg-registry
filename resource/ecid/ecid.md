# Exposome Correlation and Interpretation Database (ECID)

ECID (Exposome Correlation and Interpretation Database) is a comprehensive biomedical knowledgebase focused on curated inter-chemical correlations from core chemical datasets in exposomics research. These datasets are prioritized from human biomonitoring studies using both targeted and untargeted assays. ECID serves as a valuable resource for characterizing and understanding the effects of exposome chemicals on human health.

## Main Components

ECID is comprised of three main online modules:

1. **CCDB (Chemical Correlation DataBase)**: Allows users to explore curated inter-chemical correlations, providing insights into relationships between various environmental chemicals.

2. **EDIR (Exposome Data Interpretation Resource)**: Offers informatics resources designed to interpret the inter-chemical correlations, helping researchers make sense of complex chemical relationship data.

3. **EWS (Exposomics WorkSpace)**: Provides tools for analysis and mapping of new data into ECID resources, enabling researchers to integrate their own findings with existing knowledge.

## Development and Maintenance

ECID is developed and maintained by the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics (IDSL-ME) at the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.

## Funding

The ECID Biomedical Knowledgebase is supported (2023-2028) by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institute of Health (NIH), USA through grant U24ES035386.
