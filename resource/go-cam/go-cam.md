  title: Gene Ontology Causal Activity Modeling (GO-CAM) moves beyond GO annotations
    to structured descriptions of biological functions and systems
  year: '2019'

GO-CAM provides a structured framework for integrating Gene Ontology annotations into 
computable models of biological functions. Unlike standard GO annotations, which link 
individual gene products to GO terms, GO-CAM models connect multiple annotations to 
form causal networks that describe biological processes in greater detail. These models 
enable richer pathway and network analyses and support automated reasoning over 
biological knowledge.

## Overview

GO-CAM (Gene Ontology Causal Activity Modeling) extends the traditional Gene Ontology annotation paradigm to create causal networks that represent molecular activities and their relationships within biological systems. Each GO-CAM model represents a biological pathway or process as an interconnected set of molecular activities.

## Features and Components

- **Causal Models**: Connects molecular activities in causal chains, showing how one activity leads to another
- **Molecular Context**: Specifies cellular locations where activities occur
- **Molecular Functions**: Integrates standard GO molecular function terms
- **Biological Processes**: Associates activities with broader biological processes
- **Evidence**: Links each assertion to supporting evidence codes and literature references

## Tools and Access

- **Noctua**: Web-based collaborative editor for creating and modifying GO-CAM models
- **GO-CAM Browser**: Platform for exploring, searching, and visualizing the complete set of GO-CAM models
- **Minerva**: Backend system providing model storage, validation, and reasoning capabilities
- **API Access**: Programmatic access to models through the Gene Ontology API

## Applications

GO-CAM models are used for:
- Pathway modeling and visualization
- Systems biology analyses
- Hypothesis generation about molecular mechanisms
- Comparative analyses across species
- Data integration from multiple experimental sources
