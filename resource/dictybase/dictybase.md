# dictyBase

## Overview

dictyBase is the central online resource for the Dictyostelium research community. It provides comprehensive genomic and biological information about *Dictyostelium discoideum*, a social amoeba that serves as an important model organism for studying cell differentiation, signal transduction, cell motility, and social evolution.

## Key Features

- **Genome Data**: Complete genome assemblies and annotations for multiple Dictyostelium species
- **Gene Information**: Detailed gene pages with sequences, structures, and functional annotations
- **Phenotype Data**: Curated phenotype information from genetic studies
- **Expression Data**: Gene expression data from various developmental stages and conditions
- **Literature**: Integrated literature references and community annotations
- **Tools**: Genome browser, BLAST search, and other analysis tools

## Data Resources

dictyBase provides various downloadable datasets including:

- Genome assemblies (FASTA format)
- Gene annotations (GFF format)
- Protein sequences (FASTA format)
- RNA sequences
- Functional annotations

## Access

dictyBase data is freely accessible through:
- Web interface at https://dictybase.dev/
- GraphQL API for programmatic access
- Downloadable data files
